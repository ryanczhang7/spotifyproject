 (Know why I go easy) 
 Wait 
  
  
 King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland 
 King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again 
 King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin' 
 King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin' 
 King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed 
 King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect 
 King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it 
 King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction 
 King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated 
 King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken 
 King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse 
 King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice 
 King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion 
  
  
 Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision 
 I embrace them with collision, kings did it 
 King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king! 
 I dropped a million tears 
 I know several responsibilities put me here 
 I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned 
 The lens that I'm lookin' through 
 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free 
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas 
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me 
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace 
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef 
 What do you stand for? 
 Are you a activist? What are your city plans for? 
 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way? 
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say 
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'? 
  
  
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open? 
 Because the king don't cry, king don't die 
 King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall 
 Kingdom come, when I come, you know why 
 KING! KING! KING! KING! KING! 
 I am T'Challa","(why i go easy?)

 Trapped inside a burnin' church 
 Made it out alive, God know my worth 
 Raw face, Scarface 
 Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts

 Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge

 Hey hey, ready, set, go crazy 
 Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines 
 A life hit a nigga with a lemon's limelight 
 But at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes 
 Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside 
 Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide 
 Clean me up, beam me up to the other side 
 Brothers die, 'cause 'coons turn to butterflies 
 They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz 
 They don't wanna see me livin' on the end 
 Of the city in a citywide bend 
 Show no pity in the city full of sin 
 They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check 
 They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt

 I move like a millipede 
 When I flex them tendons like rubber trees 
 Young Millie Jackson back to the shit 
 Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory 
 Stack bodies, not figurines 
 Move beneath the surface, submarine 
 I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword 
 Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward 
 What you standing on the side for? 
 Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg 
 Spit slick, attack is subliminal 
 Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister 
 Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal 
 Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep* 
 Crushing any system, that belittles us 
 Antidote to every poison they administer 
 Switch it like time signatures 
 Colors in my aura tend cover the perimeter 
 Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through 
 Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom) 
 Wool over your eyes 
 My strength ain't nothing like my size 
 Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver 
 Tangle my cords like a weaver

 You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street 
 (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can) 
 I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer? 
 What the fuck happened? (Oh no!) 
 I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars 
 Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell) 
 Something's in the water (Something's in the water)

 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
 Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two

 You goat-mouth mammyfucker 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help 
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!"" 
 I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too 
 Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo! 
 Aw, yeah, fuck the judge 
 I made it past twenty-five, and there I was 
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him 
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
 Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"" 
 Limo tinted with the gold plates 
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah) 
  
  
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot* 
 By the time you hear the next pop 
 The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot* 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him 
 King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

 Life to me, like a box of chocolate 
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it 
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
 K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged 
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards 
 You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses 
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me 
  
  
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
  
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, God bless the kid 
 Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 
  
  
 ""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips 
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor 
 Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for 
 Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this? 
 One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist 
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him 
 Quickly because he got it 
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds? 
 No more livin' poor, meet my four-four 
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
 But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey 
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
 Well, that's me at these awards""

 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, dazed and confused 
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
 You can take your boy out the hood 
 But you can't take the hood out the homie 
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me, I’m just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I’m here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around, demolition might crush

 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I’ve been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
 I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em 
 I’d rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

 If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late 
 Your destiny, accept it, your fate 
 Burn accessories and stash them on the yard 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening, no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper

 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?

 Or leave his best friend, little brother 
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him

 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit

 This feelin' is unmatched 
 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west) 
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west) 
 Been in it before internet had new acts 
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack 
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision 
 Kendrick is master that mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
 Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
 But what's better than that? 
 The fact it brought me back home 
  
  
 We been waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
  
  
 I know everything 
 I know everything, know myself 
 I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
 I know fatality might haunt you 
 I know everything, I know Compton 
 I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious 
 I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors 
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
 I know everything, I know history 
 I know the universe works mentally 
 I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money 
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery 
 I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies 
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District 
 Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed 
 I know how people work 
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth 
 I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget 
 Until I realized I didn’t know shit 
 The day I came home 
  
  
 We been waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you 
  
  
 I met a little boy that resembled my features 
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
 Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted 
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
 He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language 
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous 
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken 
 But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it 
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor 
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 And that was bullshit 
 I know your life is full of turmoil 
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you 
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two 
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace 
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially 
 To come back home""

 Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up 
 Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
 It goes ""Sherm Sticks, burn this"" 
 That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix 
 50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras

 Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
 Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer 
 Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
 From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around 
 Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans 
 Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'? 
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
 Make it they promise to fuck with you

 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
 Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black 
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin' 
 Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
 Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
 Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows 
 No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues 
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
 I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
 Had the Coast on standby 
 “K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
 I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
 Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
 I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
 But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
 He said ""it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""

 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
 I didn't want to self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
 Going back and forth 
 Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war 
 Back in the city

 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
 ""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 20 years ago, can't forget 
 Now I can lend him a ear or two 
 How to stack these residuals tenfold 
 The liberal concept of what men'll do 
 ""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
 My American tongue was leery 
 Walked out the gas station 
 A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion 
 Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land 
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
 He begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
 Told him, ""Beat it"" 
 Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it 
 He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
 Nothin' less, nothin' more"" 
 I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost? 
  
  
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
  
 He's starin' at me in disbelief 
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave 
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 Like I was supposed to save him 
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
 And this particular person just had it down pat 
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 ""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? 
 A humble man is all that we ever need"" 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost? 
  
  
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
  
 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
 I never met a transient that demanded attention 
 They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
 So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum 
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines 
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
 I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind 
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend 
 I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin 
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'

 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre 
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
 He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet"" 
 I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep"" 
 He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free

 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
 Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
 So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
 Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
 Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
 By different shades of faces 
 Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation"" 
 It all came from God, then you was my confirmation 
 I came to where you reside 
 And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
 Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 
  
  
 Complexion (two-step) 
 Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
 Oh, Complexion (two-step) 
 It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 
  
  
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it

 (Where the homegirl Rapsody at? 
 I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!) 
  
  
 Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac 
 Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy 
 Color of your skin? Color of your eyes 
 That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey 
 All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave 
 12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark 
 I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas 
 Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid 
 And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!” 
 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored 
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times 
 If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
 It ain’t complex to put it in context 
 Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
 Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
 Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be 
 I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey 
 I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens 
 And spike your self-esteem 
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me 
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
 And it’s all beautiful to me 
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 
  
  
 Barefoot babies with no cares 
 Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car? 
 I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse

 Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see

 It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
 They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
 But homie, you made me 
 Black don't crack, my nigga 
  
  
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
 Pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me don't you? 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You're fuckin' evil 
 I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
  
  
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
  
  
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back

 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat 
  
  
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
 That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
 Curse me till I'm dead 
 Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head 
 Institutionalized manipulation and lies 
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 You hate me don't you? 
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
 Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
 Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you? 
 How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree 
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
 It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
 Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
 That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
 You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
 I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle 
 Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
 Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
 Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score 
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
 Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers"" 
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
 Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
 Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street 
 When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

 Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon

 Nobody but the number one rapper in the world 
 He done traveled all over the world 
 He came back just to give you some game 
 All of the little boys and girls, come up here

 Come right here, this is for you, come on up 
 Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother 
 I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
 But an enemigo never drown me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
  
 And (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?

 Gun in the hood, mob of police 
 Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh 
 These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front) 
 I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis 
 Dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast

 Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up 
 (Haunt you) 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
 How many times my potential was anonymous? 
 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this, nigga

 I went to war last night 
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
 I'ma do it till I get it right 
 I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night) 
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message 
 I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave 
 From a negative and letting them annihilate me 
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a building, lay my body...

 He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas"" 
 No better than Samuel on the Django 
 No better than a white man with slave boats"" 
 Sound like I needed some soul searching 
 My Pops gave me some game in real person 
 Retraced my steps on what they never taught me 
 Did my homework fast before government caught me 
 So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah 
 On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us 
 So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us 
 Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia 
 N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen 
 N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish 
 The history books overlook the word and hide it 
 America tried to make it to a house divided 
 The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong 
 So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song 
 N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more 
 Black stars can come and get me 
 Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan— 
 (one two, one two) 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
 Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
 If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
 Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? 
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? 
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome 
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing 
 But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that— 
  
  
 Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
 You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur? 
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt? 
 You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? 
 Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time? 
 Like, who got your best interest? 
 Like, how much are you dependent? 
 How clutch are the people that say they love you? 
 And who pretending? 
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in? 
 Do you show forgiveness? 
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? 
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? 
 What kind of bridge did they burn? 
 Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned 
 You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
 You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom 
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
 That considered the blessing of everyone 
 This your lesson for everyone, say; 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin' 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga— 
  
  
 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you 
 That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson 
 I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is 
 So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me? 
 Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be? 
 See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
 Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law 
 Generation X—will I ever be your ex? 
 Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause 
 Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all 
 It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
 How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
 Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
 Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin 
 Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga 
  
  
 ""I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn’t wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city 
 I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man 
 Maybe I’m just another nigga” 
  
 Shit and that’s all I wrote 
 I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain’t really a poem 
 I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to 
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you 
 I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- 
 About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground 
 What you mean by that, what the ground represent? 
  
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil 
 Right 
 That’s how I see it, my word is bond 
 I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people 
 Right 
 The poor people is gonna open up this whole world 
 And swallow up the rich people 
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat 
 And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing 
 The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like 
 You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be... 
 There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- 
 They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying? 
  
 Aight so let me ask you this then 
 Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich 
 Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? 
  
 I see myself as a natural born hustler 
 A true hustler in every sense of the word 
 I took nothin’, I took the opportunities 
 I worked at the most menial and degrading job 
 And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it 
 I went from having somebody managing me 
 To me hiring the person that works my management company 
 I changed everything, I realized my destiny 
 In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people 
 Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made millions for the record companies 
 I made millions for these movie companies 
 Now I make millions for, for us 
  
 And through your different avenues of success 
 How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 
  
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game 
 And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true"" 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying? 
 And it was happening to me for a reason 
 You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit 
 I was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 So it’s no problem, you know 
 I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know 
 I’m finna go straight through 
  
 Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that 
 Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 
  
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance 
 And not only me but, it goes down my family tree 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back 
  
 Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like 
 ""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win 
 And I wanna lay it all down"" 
  
 In this country, a black man only have like 
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength 
 And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong 
 While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 
 'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like 
 They take the heart and soul out of a man 
 Out of a black man, in this country 
 And you don’t wanna fight no more 
 And if you don’t believe me, you can look around 
 You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers 
  
 That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings 
 Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that 
 There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you 
 What you think is the future for me and my generation today? 
  
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores 
 And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed 
 For real, I don’t think America know that 
 I think America think we was just playing 
 And it’s gonna be some more playing but 
 It ain’t gonna be no playing 
 It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying? 
 It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen 
  
 That’s crazy man, in my opinion 
 Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations 
 Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know 
 Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic 
 And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out 
 Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes 
  
 Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’ 
 We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 
 Damn 
  
 I wanted to read one last thing to you 
 It’s actually something a good friend had wrote 
 Describing my world, it says: 
 “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it 
 In order to protect itself from this mad city 
 While consuming its environment 
 The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him 
 But praises the butterfly 
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness 
 And the beauty within the caterpillar 
 But having a harsh outlook on life 
 The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak 
 And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 Already surrounded by this mad city 
 The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon 
 Which institutionalizes him 
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 He’s trapped 
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as 
 Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 The result? 
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations 
 That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle 
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different 
 They are one and the same"" 
 What’s your perspective on that?

 Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down 
 And listen to this true mothafuckin' story 
 Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch 
  
  
 Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really I'm a sober soul 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And we ain't askin' for no favors 
 Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really, I'm a peacemaker 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you) 
 One day it's gon' burn you 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
  
  
  
  
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota 
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda 
 Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up 
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor 
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble 
 I hope the universe love you today 
 'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away 
 A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate 
 If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted 
 Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent 
 The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it 
 Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses 
 Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls 
 And asked them what they workin' with 
 Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth 
 Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies 
  
  
 Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red 
 Come through and bust ya head, nigga! 
 Me and the homies 
 Sag all the way to the liquor store 
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more 
 Me and the homies 
 I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas 
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in 
 Me and the homies 
 Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka 
 And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!” 
  
  
 It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin' 
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin' 
 Hungry for anything unhealthy 
 And if nutrition can help me 
 I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin' 
 We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester 
 You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses 
 Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there 
 'Cause every time we down there 
 We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards 
 Bougie bitches with no extensions 
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination 
 Before we sparked a conversation 
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like 
 Then started interrogatin' 
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean 
 I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it 
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it 
 That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent 
 Until I'm with the homies 
  
  
 (Just ridin', just ridin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Bullshittin', actin' a fool) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Trippin', really trippin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin') 
  
  
 Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had 
 A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad 
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma 
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya 
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience 
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in 
 But Jeezy still playin' 
 And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?"" 
 Pull in front of the house 
 That we been campin' out for like two months 
 The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want 
  
  
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
 Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room! 
 Wait, what?! 
 Nigga, there's somebody in this room! 
  
  
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo 
 DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk 
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right 
 Then made a left, we was just circlin' life 
 My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it."" 
 I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense 
 With the homies 
 But – they made a right, then made a left 
 Then made a right, then another right 
 One lucky night with the homies 
  
  
 K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
 Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded 
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though 
 Ooh, which one? 
 Well, which one he talkin' about? 
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it 
 I pray he ain't hit that 
 Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one 
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! 
 Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe 
 Nigga, for what? 
 What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
 ""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"" 
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there 
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street 
 There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go 
 Look, here's the plan, luv 
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park 
 'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight 
 That's what he's not gon' do 
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30 
 That's straight, but we should meet up around 12 
 I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too

 Hands up high, hands up high 
 Tell 'em dim the lights down right now 
 Put me in the mood 
 I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go 
  
  
 I recognize your fragrance 
 Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit 
 Uh, and I know your taste is 
 A little bit, hmm, high maintenance 
 Uh, everybody else basic 
 You live life on an everyday basis 
 With poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when 
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen 
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em? 
 I really wanna know you all 
 I really wanna show you off 
 Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne 
 Cold nights when you curse this name 
 You called up your girlfriends 
 And y'all curled in that little bitty Range 
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party 
 Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari 
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

 With all these seductive photographs 
 And all these one-off vacations you've been takin' 
 Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense 
 Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man 
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane 
 Take you and your momma to the motherland 
 I could do it, maybe one day 
 When you figure out you're gonna need someone 
 When you figure out it's alright here in the city 
 And you don't run from where we come from 
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice 
 You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex 
 Your natural hair and your soft skin 
 And your big ass in that sundress, ooh 
 Good God, what you doin' that walk for? 
 When I see that thing move 
 I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more 
 They say communication save relations, I can tell

 Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true 
 Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof

 Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe 
 Call me crazy, we can both be insane 
 A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain 
 I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve 
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it

 Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray 
 Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away 
 I should ask a choir: ""What do you require 
 To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"" 
 As the record spin I should pray 
 For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey 
 I got ate alive yesterday 
 I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin' 
 Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue 
 And you understand that I ain't 
 But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble 
 And live in the street with rank 
 No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study 
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
 From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang 
 Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks

 Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help 
 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until 
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will 
 It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still 
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill 
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill 
 All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere 
 As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue 
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof 
 And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo 
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through 
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile 
 I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down 
 Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest

 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell 
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell 
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill 
 You're living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A never relay a guarantee 
 And plan C never could say just what it was 
 And your plans only can pan around love 
 You love him, you love them, you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen"" 
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
 You love French tip and trip that pay for 
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more 
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt

 Out the sky and your optics turn stale 
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill 
 Of living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A only can make another mistake 
 And you can't see success coming from plan C 
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely 
 And love them and love when you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old 
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control 
 Of everything that you love, you love beef 
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police 
 You love your hood, might even love it to death

 The reason why I know you very well 
 Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? 
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal 
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal 
 When living in a world that come with plan B 
 A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free 
 And plan C just an excuse like ""because"" 
 Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love? 
 I love them, I love when I love her 
 I love so much, I love when love hurts 
 I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract 
 I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack 
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch 
 I love what the both of you have to offer 
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else 
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself 
 To the point I should hate everything I do love? 
 Should I hate living my life inside the club? 
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? 
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? 
 Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""? 
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about 
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will 
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

 This is King Kendrick Lamar 
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw 
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it 
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us 
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor 
 And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning 
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing 
 And if they take everything, know I got 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga 
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic 
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging 
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap 
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month 
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman 
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga 
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga 
 Kendrick Conan nigga 
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that 
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters 
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that 
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats 
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats 
  
  
 Will swarm on me like a beehive 
 Hop in the G ride 
 From the West to the East side 
 Know that's just how Compton roll 
  
  
 And that's a given 
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision 
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes 
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it 
 Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business 
 I blow up every time we throw up a record 
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion 
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So tell that gangster throw his set high 
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high 
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly 
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I 
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye 
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive 
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye 
 Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Now we can all celebrate 
 We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA 
 America target our rap market, as controversy and hate 
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate 
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich 
 And the broke niggas that play 
 With them gorillas that know killers 
 That know where you stay 
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé 
 This was brought to you by Dre 
 Now every motherfucker in here say: 
 ""Look who's responsible 
 For taking Compton international 
 I make 'em holla"" 
  
  
 Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie 
 Just Blaze 
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah 
 In the city of Compton 
 Ain't no city quite like mine

 Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me 
 I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me 
 I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives 
 And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by 
 Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil 
 You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you 
 All loyal so you keep eggin' me on 
 And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm 
 Last night I tried some raw oysters 
 Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit 
 That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit 
 That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written 
 That boy did it on purpose 
 That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you 
 You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after 
 And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper 
 Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga 
 I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger 
 Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk 
 Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home 
 I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town 
 You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around 
 But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down 
 Go in the booth and lay a body down 
 Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi 
 Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby 
 And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll 
 Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so"" 
 See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco 
 No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though 
 I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow 
 We all do it for the art so I could never hate though 
 Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load 
 How the game turn into the Drake show? 
 Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go? 
 Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action 
 And then you never notice they missin' 
 On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district

 No limit to where I can take it 
 And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper 
 I thought we looked out for one another 
 Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble 
 I guess it's different in the city I come from 
 All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me 
 They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me 
 The higher I get, the less they accept me 
 Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha 
 No way out 'cause I'm already in it 
 I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket 
 Good business can clean millions, I got the vision 
 I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons"" 
 Even back when I wasn't as poppin' 
 When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road 
 And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky 
 I tried to make the right choices with the world watching 
 ""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"" 
 Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life 
 And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah 
 Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child 
 Can't nobody hold me down 
 Especially not right now 
 Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile 
 Take that, take that 
 No love in they heart so they fake that 
 DiCaprio level the way they play that 
 Damn, nigga, what is that? 
 Y'all don't hear no songs 
 They hit my phone like, ""You did that"" 
 They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?""

 Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped 
 She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry 
 Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari 
 All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY 
 She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys 
 My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari 
 Look, now you got me started 
 I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley 
 I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist 
 Always gotta play it smarter

 Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me? 
 The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me 
 So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety 
 I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards 
 Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper 
 Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter 
 Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga

 Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team

 A couple somebodies started killin' themself 
 A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf 
 I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help 
 I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation 
 Bad press during the summer over allegations

 A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement 
 And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear 
 Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga 
 Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous 
 Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans 
 But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses 
 And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans

 Why you never come to where I stay? 
 Always hiding out in your New York condo 
 Why you never come to where I stay? 
 If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know 
 Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship? 
 Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense 
 Why are we focused on things 
 That don't even mean nothing, girl? 
 Why can we not find the time 
 And sit down and discuss it, girl? 
 Let me at least tell you my side of things, man 
 Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man 
  
  
 Me and you are playing house 
 Start thinking that I'm losing touch 
 Got a tight grip on you now 
 Maybe I should loosen up 
 When I leave you and I go home 
 I start forgetting what it is 
 Start to think I got to get it how I live 
 We too busy for a wedding or a kid 
 If I'm working then I know you working 
 Keep in touch with other women 
 'Cause you make me nervous 
 I empower girls that don't deserve it 
 I don't mean to do that shit on purpose 
 It's just that when I go home 
 I start forgetting what it is 
 The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6 
  
  
 And you don't ever come to where I stay at 
 You just rather stay up in your New York condo 
 You don't ever come to where I stay at

 You go up higher than me some days

 Your new shit sound like you do covers 
 Of all of my old shit, oh shit 
 I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed 
 Swear you niggas is hopeless 
 I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning 
 On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip 
 I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them 
 Drizzy still got some '06 in him 
 IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on 
 All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on 
 It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game 
 See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane 
 Pay yourself and owe yourself 
 Before you come to my city just know yourself 
 Know where you at 
 I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at 
 The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga 
  
  
 But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is 
 That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like 
 The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just.. 
 Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all 
 We went through errythang... 
 I remember you loved Jodeci 
 I mean like studied, you even made me a CD… 
  
  
 Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out 
 I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op 
 We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop 
 Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC 
 I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not 
 I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot 
 Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga 
 I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas 
 Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga 
 I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas 
 You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga 
 I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga 
 Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails 
 And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel 
 That five star in your city, they know where we at 
 I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga 
  
  
 Jodeci's back 
 You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back 
 I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none 
 The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga 
 (Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms) 
 Jodeci's back 
 Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back 
 I paint pictures and flip words 
 Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole) 
  
  
 Roof top, hoes turnt up 
 Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up 
 Wonder where she is, fuck could she be? 
 She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak 
 Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak 
 Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me 
 Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas 
 Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas 
 Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain 
 Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame 
 Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame 
 'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no 
 Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters 
 I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest 
 Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started 
 I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ******** 
 Hold your applause 
 Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards? 
 David and Goliath, takin' on the giants 
 No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole 
 No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars 
 Tappin' into '94 Nas 
 Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre 
 Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy 
 Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours 
 Just to get their dollar signed 
 Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin' 
 Trenchcoat flow, bottom line 
 To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine 
 Flow dumber than your projections 
 This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet 
 Your covers keep perplexin' me 
 Maybe it's too complex for me 
 But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales? 
 'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me

 They say that all your old girls got somebody new 
 I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"" 
 They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go"" 
 It's nothing personal 
 It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though 
 They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up 
 With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore 
 They might have loved you before 
 But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"" 
 Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere 
 It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year 
 She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"" 
 Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

 Uh, but believe I remember it all 
  
  
 I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit 
 No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit 
 No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss 
 And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit 
 Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun 
 They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come 
 I'm never scared, they never real, I never run 
 When all is said and done, more is always said than done 
 And I was told once, things will change 
 By a nigga named Tip when my deal came 
 Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange 
 Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names 
 Rochelle, Jordan 
 Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand 
 How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth? 
 How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth? 
 Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all 
 Remember how I used to feel at the start of it 
 And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale 
 And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it 
 Yeah, just lie to my ears 
 Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear 
 Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas 
 And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

 My mother is back to who she was years ago 
 It's like a new page me and her are beginning on 
 I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand 
 'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on 
 She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth 
 But I'd never break the promises I made to myself 
 And I would never make up names for myself 
 Then change the names that I just gave to myself 
 Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?"" 
 I used to brag about it to my friends 
 And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat 
 And maybe that's all they do is just pretend 
 Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it 
 Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it 
 Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love 
 'Cause I thought it was all I needed 
 Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along 
 And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit 
 They trip off the amount of people that I brought along 
 But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit 
 Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids 
 I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live 
 I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did 
 Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

 And fear that I won't remember?

 I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit

 To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?

 23 and going through a midlife crisis 
 But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife 
 And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it

 To be far from hood, but to understand the streets

 And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up 
 Damn, my reality just set in 
 And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in 
 I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in 
 So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end

 I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet 
 But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out 
 Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is 
  
  
 Uh, look, I'm the property of October 
 I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured 
 Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over 
 I think better when I'm not sober 
 I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder 
 Private flights back home, no stop over 
 Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over

 Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours 
 ‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star 
 I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane 
 Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name 
 One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change 
 And show me the city that I without fear claim 
 What I set seems to never extinguish 
 Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish 
 Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers 
 My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer 
 Heh, or alarm, or whatever 
 She be here at six in the morn' if I let her 
 But I never get attracted to fans 
 'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam 
 I always knew that I could figure 
 How to get these label heads to offer him good figures 
 And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous 
 'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas 
 It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over 
 Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over 
 Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker 
 I'll slow roast ya, got no holster 
 Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster 
 Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster 
 G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker 
 They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker 
 I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier 
 My cup runneth over 
 The same niggas I ball with, I fall with 
 On some southern drawl shit 
 Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit 
 D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all 
 These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on 
 Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off 
 First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go 
  
  
 And I'd take probation 
 I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation 
 Private plane, pick location 
 I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation 
 Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard 
 And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it 
 But in the meantime you can call me young Roy 
 Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge 
 Shit, don't leave me unguarded 
 And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi 
 Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed 
 All that blood like the Red Sea parted 
 My gun go crazy like it's retarded 
 Red light on it like it's recording 
 I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in' 
 My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't 
 Better dig in your pocket and pay homage 
 Better cover your eyes, your face fallin' 
 Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin' 
 No, I didn't say that I'm flawless 
 But I damn sure don't tarnish 
 My pistol got comments for your garments 
 I'm so high I can vomit on a comet 
 K-Y, no homo, I'm on it

 You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch 
 I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get 
 Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit 
 And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit 
 That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit 
 That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit 
 And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit 
 I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!"" 
 Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me! 
 You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat 
 Fireman burn down your entire street 
 So fly I'ma take off when I leap 
 Bye! And you can suck my wings 
 Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming 
 Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things 
 I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens

 And basically, to see a change in me 
 I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah 
 Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind 
 Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

 A little bit in love with you 
 I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit 
 A little bit in love with you 
  
  
 I know you told me break their hearts 
 But it's you I wanna take apart 
 And I will never ever be the first, to say it 
 But still I, they know I 
 I would do it, push a button 
 Pull a trigger, climb a mountain 
 Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby

 You would mean it, we could do it

 But only if you're a little bit

 I hope they never find out 
 What they already know, know, know 
 As soon as it's official 
 We'll have to let it go, go, go 
 So we don't confirm the fling 
 Keep avoiding all the questions 
 You could teach me many things 
 I'm just scared to learn a lesson 
 The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome 
 Both in sync like a Justin song 
 Feels so right but it's just, so wrong 
 I wonder where my world 'bout 
 When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out 
 And her friends say I ain't the one to go for 
 She just jealous cause you always get approached more 
 Oh well, tell her fall back 
 Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back 
 Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass 
 Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that 
 And as for you, I think I know you're the one

 Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life 
 Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life

 Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc 
 When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture 
 And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister 
 Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue 
 They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
 She call me the referee 'cause I be so official 
 My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle 
 Like the Andy Griffith theme song 
 And who told you to put them jeans on? 
 Double cup love, you the one I lean on 
 Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on 
 Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

 And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner

 So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it 
 But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it 
 You could show up at the party on dirty public transit 
 And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids

 And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy 
 And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana

 And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick 
 Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop"" 
 She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop 
 And she say I freak that pussy better

 Uh-huh 
  
  
 Uh, hardly home but always reppin' 
 You hardly on and always second 
 When I'm awake, you always restin' 
 And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned 
 I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions 
 Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin' 
 That's why I never follow y'all suggestions 
 I just always did my own thing 
 Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas 
 I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes 
 Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better 
 'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

 Yeah, wrong way down a one-way 
 Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday 
 Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who 
 Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you"" 
 And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house 
 Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth 
 Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her 
 I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther 
 I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady 
 They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady 
 Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy 
 Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady 
 Damn, whose line is it anyways? 
 I'm in a daze, you been amazed 
 Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage 
 I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze 
 I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice 
 And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright 
 Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will 
 I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real 
 Put it to your life

 Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest 
 Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused 
 The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's 
 Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust 
 Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on 
 I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb 
 I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight 
 From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike 
 Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night 
 Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white 
 Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right 
 Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night 
 This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long 
 The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song 
 UGK and Young Money, too strong 
 Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

 You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah 
 There is nothing I can do to fix it 
 All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

 And I finally get a moment to myself 
 I will realize you were everything I'm missing 
 And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

 Night's fallin', lights glowing 
 And I'm just trying to pay the price owing 
 And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing 
 And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments

 I'm just so far gone 
 October's own 
 Please leave me alone 
 Drunk off champagne 
 Screamin' in the phone 
 See my house is not a home 
 Fuck is going on? 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Where do we belong? 
 Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone 
 Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on 
 When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone 
 Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne 
 And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't 
 Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known 
 To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone 
 Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown 
 I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown 
 It's only been three years 
 Look at how I've grown 
 I'm just in my zone 
 I call this shit the calm 
 Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm 
 Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond 
 Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long 
 You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm 
 Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known 
 I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne 
 I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause 
  
  
 You know everything gon' be all right, I promise 
 I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but 
 40 Mama always say don’t ask permission 
 Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah 
 Say 
  
  
 Uh 
 And life is so insane 
 Look what I became trying to make a name 
 All my first dates are interrupted by my fame 
 Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain 
 They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain 
 It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain 
 Women need attention, therefore, women will complain 
 Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame 
 Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game 
 I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne 
 It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing 
 So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain 
 Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange 
 'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed 
 Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range 
 And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change 
 Damn, and I can only feel his pain 
 'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain 
 So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again 
 He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain 
 I'm why your girl heart is in a sling 
 Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame 
 As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king 
 With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain 
 Yeah, and see, this is the thang 
 What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain 
 The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane 
 Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

 Did he give you loving just like this? 
 Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?

 I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing 
 Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin' 
 But I ain't with the hard talk 
 I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk 
 Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark 
 Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start 
 I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin' 
 My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin' 
 And my verses gettin' stupider 
 Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter? 
 Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular 
 I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula 
 I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula 
 When I break it down, when I, when I break it down 
 I hug and kiss the drum kick 
 I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit 
 But, you could never beat my ass, pause

 Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in

 And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them 
 Right, uh 
  
  
 It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy 
 Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy 
 They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege 
 But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say 
 I got the key to happiness and all the copies 
 Remember this day like you bought a poppy 
 And damn, how I get so nice? 
 I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice 
 Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin' 
 I always choose dough like it's my only option 
 'Cause money always knows best 
 Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest"" 
 And I'm what all the fuss about 
 And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout

 Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace 
 Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet 
 Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me? 
  
  
 You've got me fe– 
 You, ohhhh 
 You've got me fe– 
 You, ohhhh, ayy 
  
  
 Missin' out on my years 
 There's times when I wish I was where I was 
 Back when I used to wish I was here 
 Missin' out on my days 
 Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise 
 Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways 
 I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade 
 Most times it's just somebody that's underaged 
 That's probably just alone and afraid 
 And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain 
 I always hear people complain about the place that they live 
 That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give 
 'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit 
 That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is 
 I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome 
 Then she finally got to Rome 
 And all she did was post pictures for people at home 
 'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known 
 I know another girl that's cryin' out for help 
 But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone"" 
 I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone 
 I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown 
 To post later and make it look like she still on the go 
 Look at the way we live 
 I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world 
 I was hidin' the world from my kid 
 From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate 
 Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate 
 Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs 
 The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call 
 They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?"" 
 You know a wise man once said nothin' at all 
 I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend 
 All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch 
 All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end? 
 I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

 I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who? 
 I'll let you bring a thousand recruits 
 My peers are a talented group 
 But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two 
 Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops 
 There's still nothin' they could really do 
 It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due 
 Whenever it's time to recoup 
 Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal 
 In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?"" 
 I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die 
 What you got, time on your hands or time on your side? 
 Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? 
 Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? 
 Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies 
 Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties 
 And all of these fortunate times 
 And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? 
 Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? 
 Like healin' my soul, like family time 
 Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? 
 Is there more? 
  
  
 Passion, instant 
 Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me) 
 Cupid's shot me 
 My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing) 
 Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me) 
 It feels so exciting 
 Thought of highly (Highly) 
 It's yours entirely 
 I'll be, I'll be more than a lover 
 More than a woman 
 More than a lover for you","only holdin' up i do is my end of the bargain only beggin' that i do is me beggin' your pardon only tryin' that i do is me tryin' the hardest only problems i do are math problems with profit only lyin' i do is lyin' out in the tropics only cryin' i do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it only lackin' i can do is my lack of responses only rest that i do is ""where the rest of my commas?"" still i rise, maya angelou vibes when life comin' at you from all angles and sides and they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside it really boils down to how you plan to survive love certain ones but never get attached to 'em give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em? especially when another girl i flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom and they recognize the bathroom all hell starts to break loose in my texts i only tell lies to who i gotta protect i would rather have you remember me how we met i would rather lose my leg than lose their respect but that'll never happen the way i'm watchin' my step that ain't what i'm 'bout i'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt if i can't make it with you, i'll make it without they say take the good with the bad, i'll take it without houston women i wine-and-dine and take to the house my moral compass is janky, it breaks in the south is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts? is there more to life than sayin' i figured it out? is there more? yeah  sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice the boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot too many walt disney characters, mouses and goofs i mean you know i love a challenge, but challenged by who? i'll let you bring a thousand recruits my peers are a talented group but even if you take all their statistics and carry the two even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops there's still nothin' they could really do it's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due whenever it's time to recoup yeah, soon as this album drop i'm out of the deal in the house playin' d'angelo, ""how does it feel?"" i got a fear of havin' things on my mind when i die what you got, time on your hands or time on your side? is there any sense in doin' these songs when i'm high? is there more to life than goin' on trips to dubai? yachts on the 4th of july, g5 soarin' the skies is there more to life than all of these corporate ties and all of these fortunate times and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? am i missin' somethin' that's more important to find? like healin' my soul, like family time is there more to life than just when i'm feelin' alive? is there more?  passion, instant sweat beads, feel me (feel me) cupid's shot me my heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing) tempt me, drive me (tempt me) it feels so exciting thought of highly (highly) it's yours entirely i'll be, i'll be more than a lover more than a woman more than a lover for you"

 Yesterday morning was crazy 
 I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe 
 That shit is in stone, sealed and signed 
 She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine 
 Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time 
 And all it took was one time 
 Shit, we only met two times, two times 
 And both times were nothin' like the new times 
 Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines 
 Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes 
 It's breakin' my spirit 
 Single father, I hate when I hear it 
 I used to challenge my parents on every album 
 Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent 
 Always promised the family unit 
 I wanted it to be different because I've been through it 
 But this is the harsh truth now 
 And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now 
 I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at 
 Or who loves you more or who's not there 
 Who did what to who 'fore you got here 
 Nah, look, I'm too proud 
 To let that come between me and you now 
 Realize I gotta think for two now 
 I gotta make it, I better make it 
 I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated 
 This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated 
 I can't forget the looks on they faces 
 Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin' 
 Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out 
 For our cheers to the next generation 
 But this Champagne toast is short-lived 
 I got an empty crib in my empty crib 
 I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick 
 I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts 
 Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit 
 But man, you know 
 I still had to get it for my boy though, you know 
 You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip 
 He probably coulda did stand-up 
 Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up 
 And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up 
 October baby for irony's sake, of course 
 I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours 
 And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more 
 Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground 
 They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town 
 Hopefully by the time you hear this 
 Me and your mother will have come around 
 Instead of always cuttin' each other down 
 God willin', I got a good feelin' 
 You got a good spirit 
 We'll talk more when you hear this my G 
  
  
 I'm changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man

 No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina 
 Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season 
 Queen Street visions that nobody believed in

 Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd 
 The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin' 
 Not when everybody out here beefin'

 Too late for condolences when it's over with

 Not when you have it

 Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage 
 Why is my struggle different than others'? 
 Only child that’s takin' care of his mother 
 As health worsens and bills double 
 That’s not respectable all of a sudden? 
 I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up? 
 What do you see when you see me? 
 When did all the things I mean 
 From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning? 
 Maybe I share it with too many people 
 Back then it used to just feel like our secret 
 Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it 
 I be tryna manifest the things I needed 
 And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me 
 But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all 
 How they go from not wantin' me at all 
 To wantin' to see me lose it all? 
 Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin' 
 I'm overcome with emotions 
 Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober 
 Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra 
 I could only speak what I know of 
 Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin' 
 And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin' 
 And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin' 
 All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies 
 Ego strokin', picture postin' 
 Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only 
 But you just had to show me 
 See, I know, 'cause I study you closely 
 I know when someone lyin' 
 I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired 
 I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet 
 Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you 
  
  
 Did I? Did I? 
 Did I lose you? 
 Did I? Did I? 
 Did I lose you?

 As you beg, I testify that 
 I hate being alone 
 But you finally got me out my zone 
 I know and I miss you 
 Know when I'm tripping 
 Oh, yes it's difficult 
 Thank God I'm Christian 
 Remember how this all begun, just us 
 My mama said you was bad news 
 Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun"" 
 You proved her right, every single night 
 Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes 
 Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do 
 I'm in some kind of mood 
 You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

 Saturday to Saturday 
 You see that I've been goin' through it 
 Hopin' everything's okay 
 I just want to let you know 
 Everything these days is textual 
 I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you 
 'Cause I remember way, way back 
 With the waves under the wave cap 
 You were someone else's wife in fact 
 You didn't even look at me like that 
 Then it all just switched, over time 
 Step by step and you know what's next

 Hand on my heart 
 And I, I wish time never mattered 
  
  
 Yeah, stylin’ though 
 Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though 
 All the things you need, you still want problems though 
 All the things I know, I still been silent though 
 Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo 
 Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes 
 I don't want to have to go to funerals 
 I gotta start sleepin' at the studio 
 I don't have no time to be no Romeo 
 All the love I need is at the rodeo 
 All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah 
 All the girls I know are there with E and Tho 
 Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old? 
 Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes 
 Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone 
 I take a glass of Domina to go with me home 
 Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome 
 I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on 
 Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves 
 I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views 
 Saw a side of myself that I just never knew 
 I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do 
 Steady doin' double shifts 
 1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click 
 More blessings because I'm generous 
 Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us 
 Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet 
 She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it 
 Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it 
 Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it 
 Scary whenever I close my eyes at night 
 Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life 
 I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights 
 But you can rest assured that my mind is right 
 Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days 
 Never stick around to see shit change 
 Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' 
 Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin' 
 Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV 
 To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' 
 I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this 
 Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense 
 Especially people that want to lecture me 
 And frame it like they just want the best for me 
 Or they check for me, whatever splits it up 
 So there's more for them and there's less for me 
 They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me 
 No one's done it successfully 
 7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me 
 Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery 
 Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me 
 That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency 
 Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally 
 Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly 
 If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me 
 You overnight celebrity, you one day star 
 Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity 
 I am a reflection of all of your insecurities 
 Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping 
 Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me 
 There's real ones around me 
 I want to make sure they learn from me 
 I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety 
 He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency 
 My life is centered 'round competition and currency 
 Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery 
 Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me 
 I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary 
 More Life","silence keeps cloudin' me hand on my heart and i, i wish time never mattered  yeah, stylin’ though dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though all the things you need, you still want problems though all the things i know, i still been silent though yeah, used to be at silvercity, indigo used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes i don't want to have to go to funerals i gotta start sleepin' at the studio i don't have no time to be no romeo all the love i need is at the rodeo all the love i need is here at ovo, yeah all the girls i know are there with e and tho who knows where i end up when that shit gets old? maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes last table left in carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone i take a glass of domina to go with me home might move our annual shit to the 'dome i need 40,000 people to see what i'm on yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves i was an angry yute when i was writin’ views saw a side of myself that i just never knew i’ll probably self-destruct if i ever lose, but i never do steady doin' double shifts 1da doin’ the beat and i open up like a double click more blessings because i'm generous thirty-seater plane for like ten of us remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it scary whenever i close my eyes at night wakin’ up to public statements about my private life i can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights but you can rest assured that my mind is right get no sick days, i leave for like three months in six days never stick around to see shit change get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' seasons go by like i'm binge-watchin' went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv to not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' i can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this distractions will do you in, in the truest sense especially people that want to lecture me and frame it like they just want the best for me or they check for me, whatever splits it up so there's more for them and there's less for me they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me no one's done it successfully 7am in germany, can't believe that they heard of me last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me that's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly if we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me you overnight celebrity, you one day star swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity i am a reflection of all of your insecurities behind closed doors, a lot of 6 god worshipping done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me there's real ones around me i want to make sure they learn from me i want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency my life is centered 'round competition and currency takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me i need recovery maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me i'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary more life"

 How you can stand there is beyond me 
  
  
 All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore 
 How do you not check on me when things go wrong 
 Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer 
 Much closer 
 All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore 
 Guess that's what they say you need family for 
 Cause I can't depend on you anymore 
  
  
 Always saw you for what you could've been 
 Ever since you met me 
 Like when Chrysler made that one car 
 That looked just like the Bentley 
 I always saw you for what you could've been 
 And even when it's business with you it's personal again 
 I knew you before you made ends meet 
 And now we're meeting our end 
  
  
 And it's all because you chose a side 
 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You're so predictable I hate people like you 
 Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you 
 How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through 
 You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
 You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures 
 I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas 
 With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong 
 Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on 
 I don't know what's going on 
  
  
 And it's all because you chose a side 
 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align 
 My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right 
 When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice 
 But you always had something to say every other time 
 Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way 
 I'm fooding and serving them all 
 Like I'm working for minimum wage 
 Someone up there must just love testing my patience 
 Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment 
 Forgiveness for your ways 
 If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised 
 Same way I'm right here still feeling the way 
 Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that 
  
  
 All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore 
 How do you not check on me when things go wrong

 Guess that's what they say you need your family for 
 Cause I can't depend on you anymore

 Any time people want to start problems 
 It's like “for real, are you dumb?” 
 You know who mans are 
 I'm not afraid no gyal heart man 
 And I'm not afraid of no cyattie 
 And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither

 So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious 
 I don't run out of material 
 You shouldn't speak on me, period 
 You try to give 'em your side of the story 
 They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it 
 They feeling a way and won't hide it 
 Niggas done being silent 
 Don't get along man, we tried it 
 What's the point of even tryin'? 
 I hate a goofy especially 
 They always dyin' to mention me 
 They gotta go, they gotta go 
 They gotta die out eventually 
 I cannot give 'em no empathy 
 I'ma have B's when I'm 70 
 They cannot fuck with the legacy 
 I don't know what else is left for me 
 After this no one a threat to me 
 My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies 
 I don't let it get to me 
  
  
 Done 
 Look what I've done in my life

 Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny 
 Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies 
 Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries 
 Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it 
 He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement 
 He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment 
 Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission 
 We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him 
 Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know 
 Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show 
 I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?"" 
 I mean, you boys not even coming close 
 I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration 
 You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places 
 Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear 
 Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care 
 No tender love and care, no love and affection 
 I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting 
 I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson 
 Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together 
 Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester 
 40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure 
 A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin' 
 A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation 
 Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day 
 You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday 
 You don't be scorin' perfect 
 You don't be workin' like how we be workin' 
 You platinum like wrappers 
 On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless 
 You get the message over and over like it was urgent 
 And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person 
 The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in 
 And did it with a purpose 
 Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships 
 Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension 
 A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned 
 Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention 
 It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder 
 The most successful rapper 35 and under 
 I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under 
 That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded 
 Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin 
 She violated, I sent her back where it all started 
 How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment 
 Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness 
 Told my momma that I found a lady in the east 
 Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite 
 Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free 
 I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me 
 You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique 
 Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats 
 I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat 
 Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE 
 The best ever, don't ever question, you know better 
 But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together 
 Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it 
 Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled 
 Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal 
 Don't let your newfound fame fool you 
 Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this 
 Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter 
 Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit 
 Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it 
 Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it 
 Too busy face screwin' on waste movements 
 You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin' 
 First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it 
 And they still take to it 
 Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid 
 And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it 
 But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful 
 But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want 
 Get high when I want

 Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women 
 I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it

 Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me 
 That mean a lot to me 
 Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me 
 This year for Christmas I just want apologies 
 Sydney gave up on me when I went missin' 
 Syn had a baby and treated me different 
 Erika sued me and opened a business 
 Wonder if they wish it could've been different 
 Wonder what they'd do put in my position 
 I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen? 
 Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions 
 I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven 
 Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough 
 Until enough is enough, and then it's too much 
 You tip the scale when I weigh my options 
 West Palm girls are spoiled rotten 
 Tiffany on you, you know you poppin' 
 I'll kill somebody if they give you problems 
 Master bedroom's where we get it poppin' 
 Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet 
 I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit 
 Sell my secrets and get top dollar 
 Sell my secrets for a Range Rover 
 Opportunity and temptation 
 They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation 
 Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'

 My city love me like a college running back 
 Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at 
 Took you from the hood and I could never give you back 
 I just wanna let you know that someone love you back 
 All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass 
 Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at? 
 Riding...

 And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham 
 A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section 
 OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up 
 And I know who gon' take the fall with me 
 They right here on call with me, they all with me 
 You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted 
 They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it? 
 Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me 
 I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me 
 Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday 
 Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray 
 I dropped out right before I graduate 
 Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day 
 “It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait” 
 And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say 
 Lately I just feel so out of character 
 The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance 
 Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist 
 I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison 
 I'm gettin' straight to the point with it 
 Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas 
 Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition 
 It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business 
 But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute 
  
  
 Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals 
 My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below 
 Who you think runnin' this show? 
 You saw it in me at 20 years old 
 The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code 
 I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate 
 You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made 
 Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change 
 Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game 
 Still drop 40 with liquor in my system 
 Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance 
 I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya 
 Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian 
 Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale 
 And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales 
 Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL 
 I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself 
 Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts 
 I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts 
 They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon 
 I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room 
 Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus 
 And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us 
 Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever 
 I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together 
 And my life is on display like Truman 
 They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner 
 My exes made some of my favorite music 
 I dated women from my favorite movies 
 Karma's such a thing of beauty 
 I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it

 But, I'm not really sure what else you expected 
 When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective 
 With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message 
 40, did you get the message? 
 'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it 
 I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort 
 But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together 
 Yeah, not here to fight wars 
 But niggas wanna talk high scores 
 PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche 
 And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for 
 But, I got bigger fish to fry 
 I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I 
 Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine 
 And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified 
 Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night 
 Flyin' over Chattanooga 
 Out here tryna spread the movement 
 I just got me the Mercedes Pullman 
 You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google 
 Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal 
 These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies 
 They've been droppin' out on both sides 
 We ain't in it, we just ghost ride 
 The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines 
 I thought you wanted yours like I want mine 
 I guess you just makin' moves on your own time 
 But just know it'll be January in no time 
 And your absence is very concernin' 
 It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin' 
 Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30 
 Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey 
 I got a club in the Raptors arena 
 Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons 
 Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with 
 I'm legally obligated if they request it 
 So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson 
 Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction 
 Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting 
 Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum 
 I just listened to Closer to My Dreams 
 Wide eyed and uneducated at 19 
 I can't rap like that, all young and naive 
 Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe 
 Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience 
 I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it 
 4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious 
 You loved me back in the basement 
 Guess it is what we make it 
 I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways 
 Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away 
 Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother 
 The season start and I don't wanna 
 See you end up with nothin' 
 Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion 
 Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin' 
 They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden 
 Now you the one gettin' buckets 
 They put their arm around you 
 Now you becomin' the crutches 
 Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to 
 And women that you seen on TV look better in person 
 And either they wanna fuck you or convince you 
 That they care to see where it goes from there 
 But these ain't the girls from Brampton 
 This ain't that local action 
 The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually 
 What happened to the things 
 You niggas said was supposed to happen? 
 Are we just supposed to 
 Ignore the fact that it never happened? 
 We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two? 
 Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you? 
 My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf 
 And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves 
 Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios 
 6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit 
 When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I 
 And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I"" 
 Way before niggas had they hands out 
 Like they doin' macarena

 Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it 
 I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it 
 I told 1da send me something and I got it covered 
 Somehow I always rise above it 
 Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? 
 The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive 
 Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor 
 Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested 
 Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question 
 Last night I went to sleep wanting more 
 Tryna decide what direction I should go towards 
 Some nights I wish I could go back in life 
 Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 
 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me 
 Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me 
 Prolly forever if I stay in my zone 
 I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone 
 I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe 
 That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside 
 Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage 
 You need to act your age and not your girl's age 
 It gets worse by the annual 
 My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man 
 Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah 
 I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em 
 To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention 
 I remember when it used to be music that did it 
 But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? 
 I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with 
 I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with 
 If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin' 
 We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on 
 But here we are, yeah 
 Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence 
 They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments 
 Bitches alter my messages like we had words 
 And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve 
 Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing 
 Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image 
 I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year 
 Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year 
 And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 
 'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block 
 Nobody lookin' out for nobody 
 Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody 
 Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it 
 And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it 
 And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it 
 Damn, I just had to say my piece about it 
 Oh, you gotta love it— 
 But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject 
 I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget 
 I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins 
 Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca 
 Julia, Ericka, Southern America 
 Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance 
 Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow 
 Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent 
 I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' 
 But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement 
 Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? 
 Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too 
 I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas 
 Bein' number two is just being the first to lose 
 My city dictated music, nobody seein' us 
 Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up 
 Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough 
 Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup 
 Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all 
 You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all 
 ""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago 
 Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go 
 Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? 
 Why you rappin' like you come from the streets? 
 I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees 
 And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves 
 Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease 
 I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese 
 Special order for anybody that's comin' for me 
 Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze 
 You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me 
 Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free 
 I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat 
 Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats 
 Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah 
 And on top of that it's getting harder to eat 
 Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease 
 To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me 
 And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe 
 But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh) 
 Yeah 
 And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop) 
 I know your girl well, just not in public 
 Blame the city, I'm a product of it 
 Young nigga from the city 
 You gotta love it 
  
  
 Yeah, gotta love it

 Yeah","yeah yeah  oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it i heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it i told 1da send me something and i got it covered somehow i always rise above it why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? the game is all mine and i'm mighty possessive lil wayne could not have found him a better successor every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested allen iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question last night i went to sleep wanting more tryna decide what direction i should go towards some nights i wish i could go back in life not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me prolly forever if i stay in my zone i speak on this generation, but can't change it alone i heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in vibe that's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside oh, you tried? it's so childish calling my name on the world stage you need to act your age and not your girl's age it gets worse by the annual my career's like a how-to manual, so i guess it's understandable, man oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em to show they outfits off, guess they need the attention i remember when it used to be music that did it but then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? i'm managed by my friends that i grew up with i'd rather give that 15% to people i fuck with if me and future hadn't made it with this rappin' we'd prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on but here we are, yeah lately, i feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments bitches alter my messages like we had words and stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve bitter women i'm overtextin' are pmsing crazy this year—fuckin' with my image i've been tryna reach the youth so i can save 'em this year fuck it, i guess i gotta wait 'til next year and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 'bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block nobody lookin' out for nobody maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can tweet about it and then they start to ""r.i.p."" about it and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it damn, i just had to say my piece about it oh, you gotta love it— but they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject i been whippin' mercedes and nigga try to budget i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins shout out to ashley, tasha, bianca julia, ericka, southern america part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow comeback flow, once i start it's apparent i'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' but fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too i wanna prove that i'm number one over all these niggas bein' number two is just being the first to lose my city dictated music, nobody seein' us winter here already, but somehow i'm heatin' up been observin' the game and felt like i've seen enough let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all you rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all ""best i ever had"" seems like a decade ago decadent flow and i still got a decade to go oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? why you rappin' like you come from the streets? i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees and i'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese special order for anybody that's comin' for me shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze you see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, oli, and me cuttin' all loose ends, i be the barber for free i'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat feel like i'm in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah and on top of that it's getting harder to eat rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease to think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me and now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe but, man, oh, you gotta love it (oh) yeah and head to toe, i'm prada covered (whoop) i know your girl well, just not in public blame the city, i'm a product of it young nigga from the city you gotta love it  yeah, gotta love it *laughs* yeah"

 Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record 
 Just to off these records, nigga that's a record 
 I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure 
 Past the present when you have to mention 
 This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though 
 Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go 
 Heavy airplay all day with no chorus 
 We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas 
 I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga 
 I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga 
 Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga 
 I could go a hour on this beat, nigga 
 I'm just as famous as my mentor 
 But that's still the boss, don't get sent for 
 Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for 
 Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more 
 Hot temper, scary outcome 
 Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one 
 That always let they mouth run 
 Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it 
 Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it 
 Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick 
 Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit 
 Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich 
 Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup 
  
  
 Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV 
 Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me 
 Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me 
 I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family 
 Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' 
 I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it 
 I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it 
 Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin' 
 On a mission tryna shift the culture 
 Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit 
 Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin' 
 All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments 
 Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message 
 Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive 
 That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure 
 Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort 
 I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless 
 Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace 
 My life's a completed checklist 
 I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now 
 Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now 
 That's real 
  
  
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento 
 I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo 
 The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk 
 Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow 
 This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo 
 I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em) 
 The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie 
 All these 90's fantasies on my mind 
 The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time 
 I might come through without security to check if you're fine 
 That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO 
 Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself"" 
 You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself 
 And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help 
 You know, back on your feet and shit 
 Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? 
 Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese 
 And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

 What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now 
 Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now 
 What more can I say now? What more can I say now? 
 You might feel like nothin' was the same 
  
  
 I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low 
 Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low 
 I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low 
 The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know 
 I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low 
 Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

 And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya 
 Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya 
 You know that paper my passion 
 Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened 
 I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish 
 I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's 
 And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it 
 Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked 
 Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender 
 Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together 
 You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition 
 But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

 Luckily I didn't have to grow there 
 I would only go there cause niggas that I know there 
 I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush

 He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy 
 You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be 
 People like Mazin who was a best friend to me 
 Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life 
 And this life started lacking synergy

 You've been caught up 
 With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love 
 You shouldn't have to deal with that 
 I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause... 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us 
 So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? 
 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love 
  
  
 Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive 
 Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance 
 I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping 
 I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different 
 Started realizing a couple places I could take it 
 I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement 
 I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation 
 And influence a generation that's lacking in patience 
 I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience 
 Just me and my old man getting back to basics 
 We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted 
 When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing 
 Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas 
 We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us 
 We even talked about you and our couple of moments 
 He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups 
 You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone 
 Looking like you came from the 70's on your own 
 My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is 
 Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? 
 You don't even know what you want from love anymore 
 I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? 
 Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us 
 So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? 
 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love 
  
  
 Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures 
 Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage 
 When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit 
 A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 
 'Cause that night I played her three songs 
 Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on 
 Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz 
 Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off 
 Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria 
 Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria 
 Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music 
 When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it 
 The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree 
 I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me 
 Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? 
 Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't 
 Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz 
 Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision 
 Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions 
 When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven 
 It seem like you don't want this love anymore 
 I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? 
 Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us

 Isn't it amazing? 
 How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication 
 How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing 
 How every conversation starts with ""this time will be different"" 
 Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun 
 Oh, the idea is so fun every time 
 At least we try for home run every time 
  
  
 Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging 
 Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me 
 Same city, same friends, if you're looking 
 I'll be here just swanging 
 Don't talk to me like I'm famous 
 And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe 
 I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby 
 Yeah, swanging 
  
  
 She just wanna run around the city and make memories 
 That she can barely remember 
 And I'd allow her 
 Talk about pussy power 
 She just wanna run over my feelings 
 Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler 
 And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power 
 She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself"" 
 Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was 
 And never leave as myself 
 But when it falls apart, I'm always still down 
 To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground 
 Wish you would learn to love people and use things 
 And not the other way around

 I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is 
 She call and tell me be here before the sun up 
 I be dressed before we hung up 
 I take Eglinton to 401 east 
 And exit at Markham road in the east end 
 Where all the pretty girls are sleeping 
 My license been expired I renew it after the weekend 
 Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends 
 Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness 
 I hate stoppin' for gas this late 
 Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin' 
 Summer is comin' know you could feel it 
 20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it 
 Won't knock on your door 
 My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours"" 
 I got the pedal to the floor 
 I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin' 
 Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there 
 I'll be there just swangin'

 Done sayin' I'm done playin' 
 Last time was on the outro 
 Stuck in the house, need to get out more 
 I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising 
 Most people in my position get complacent 
 Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages 
 I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it 
 Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it 
 I'm the only one that's putting shots up 
 And like a potluck, you need to come with it 
 Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100 
 Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted 
 I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it 
 Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming? 
 Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"" 
 These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there 
 Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out 
 Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now 
 Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out 
 She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

 Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods 
 Money got my whole family going backwards 
 No dinners, no holidays, no nothin' 
 There's issues at hand that we're not discussin' 
 I did not sign up for this 
 My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list 
 And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit 
 Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit 
 Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear 
 Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here 
 Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself 
 That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit 
 And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now 
 Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now 
 Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down

 Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion

 I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit 
 Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets 
 I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine 
 Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip 
 My new girl is on Glee and shit 
 Probably making more money than me and shit 
 I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
 I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one 
 Like I got trust issues

 I got no one to call, no one 
 And people only love you when they're needing your wealth 
 Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan 
 Everybody acting like they give a damn 
 Where is everybody when you need a hand? 
 I've been burning rubber on the Michelin 
 Flying in the rain like I'm Superman 
 I could say I love it, but that just depends
