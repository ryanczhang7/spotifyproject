 Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone

 Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich 
 Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence 
 I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick 
 ""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"" 
 And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin' 
 My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list 
 Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted"" 
 My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with 
 Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted 
 My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick 
 I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business 
 And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em 
 20 years old is when I came in the game 
 And now it's eight years on and you remember the name 
 And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today 
 But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great 
 I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware 
 Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked 
 You know I want way more than I already got 
 Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

 I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh) 
 From Taco Bell to TRL 
 I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until 
 As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict 
 Funny 'cause I had pop appeal 
 But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?) 
 And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?) 
 In my eyelids now (What?) 
 I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah) 
 Without a doubt, by any means 
 If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em 
 I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes 
 Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between 
 You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams 
 Not even when I'm on my deathbed 
 Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet 
 So why would I quit? 
 The thought that I would stop when I'm dead 
 Just popped in my head 
 I said it, then forgot what I said

 You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip 
 Man, you know just what I mean 
 Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it 
 Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it? 
 Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin' 
 It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em 
 She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit 
 Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money? 
 Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles 
 Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow 
 The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit 
 Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit 
 Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober 
 Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

 Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine 
 I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
 The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind 
 So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 And when the world's against me is when I really come alive 
 And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride 
 You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs 
 I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun 
 I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up 
 Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
 Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree 
 To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key 
 And you'll see 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more 
  
  
 Another one to take the sting away 
 I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
 Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
  
  
 I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong 
 I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell 
 Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
 And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun 
 Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run 
 I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become 
 Conversations with my father on the A14 
 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
 Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me 
 With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans 
 Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou' 
 I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud 
 And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
 The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now 
 Somehow 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more

 And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

 Made friends and lost them through the years 
 And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown

 Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
 Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""

 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
  
  
 Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes 
 Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
 Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right 
 But I was younger then, take me back to when 
  
  
 We found weekend jobs, when we got paid 
 We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

 One works down by the coast

 One's just barely getting by

 And I can't wait to go home

 She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home 
 I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets 
 To carry love, to carry children of our own 
 We are still kids, but we're so in love 
 Fighting against all odds

 But she fell in love with an English man 
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
 Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"" 
  
  
 I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar 
 She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar 
 She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm? 
 Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? 
 She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun 
 She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun 
 Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar 
 Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance 
  
  
 You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band 
 But she fell in love with an English man 
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand 
 Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"" 
 With my pretty little Galway Girl 
 You're my pretty little Galway Girl 
  
  
 You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool 
 And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room 
 As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool 
 After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes 
 I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet 
 A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat 
 Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week 
 And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl 
  
  
 And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time 
 I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine 
 Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine 
 As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night 
 I walked her home then she took me inside 
 To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine 
 I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write 
 About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

 Goes to the gym at least six times a week 
 Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet 
 And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats 
 He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached 
 Owns every single Ministry CD 
 Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means 
 But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me 
 But still, I'm just keepin' it real 
 Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil' 
 I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back 
 'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at 
 Let me remind you of the days when 
 You used to hold my hand 
 And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans

 Just a young boy tryin' to be loved

 And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse 
 Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas 
 Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous 
 He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime 
 And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign 
 Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"" 
 But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you 
 You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin' 
 Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin' 
 Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym 
 Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim 
 In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him

 Packed up the photo album Matthew had made 
 Memories of a life that's been loved 
 Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals 
 Poured the old ginger beer down the sink 
 Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down"" 
 But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink 
  
  
 Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know 
 A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved 
  
  
 So I'll sing Hallelujah

 When I fell down you'd be there holding me up 
 Spread your wings as you go 
 When God takes you back 
 He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home"" 
  
  
 I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up 
 Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case 
 John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek 
 And wiped a tear from the side of my face 
  
  
 I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know 
 A life with love is a life that's been lived

 Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know

 Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree 
 And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon 
 Looking around for the things that I left on the ground

 Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance 
 Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance? 
 Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence 
 Oh well, she’s a local girl 
 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man 
 It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after 
 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese 
 And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need 
 I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley 
 She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi 
 Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat 
 B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly 
 She knows me well 
 Bit of a catch to have a local girl 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man 
  
  
 I don’t wanna go alone 
 I don’t wanna go alone 
 No, I don't wanna go alone 
  
  
 Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her 
 Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand 
 Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair 
 All I wanna do is be near 
 Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her 
 Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand 
 Tell her that I love her more than anyone else 
 If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself 
  
  
 And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers 
 We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers 
 If we talk outside, say ""Hey what's new?"" 
 I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you 
 Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright 
 I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type 
 Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing

 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free

 The times I'm living in

 Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute? 
 The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones 
 I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones 
 Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum 
 It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots 
 What's better than thinking about the ones you love? 
 Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love 
 I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above 
 Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up 
 No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan 
 No one here to save the day now you're all alone 
 Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth 
 Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone 
  
  
 And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes 
 And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when

 I'm 31 now, I'm still saying ""Yes Nan"" 
 You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one 
 I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like 
 Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like 
 And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write 
 Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine 
 Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die 
 And when I'm gone I want my music to play 
 And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry

 To see my family 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 As my mother sleeps 
  
  
 I don't know about James bond 
 But round here nobody lives twice 
 When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye 
 Cause only a judge can give you life 
 This is my advice 
 Trust me, I nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after I got this ride 
 Pissed like I had way too much wine 
 Wished I didn't get one 
 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this 
  
  
 I never had a playlist in my heart 
 Now I need an A list just to chart 
 But I've been famous from the start 
 How am I gonna make my mark? 
  
  
 Are you gonna play me though? 
 This song was never meant for the radio 
 (I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing

 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there? 
 To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
 I am my music, my music is me 
 Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly 
 Angels to die","listen, little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, thursday you work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try and you remember that your punter went crazy last night you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for you'll make a trip to the whittington where they'll look at your jaw they'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure they'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door but young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  little lady, your mind you've made up your injuries you can't hide with make-up you need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just in case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb with any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip last year when your pimp just lost it he wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway cause all the heroin is making you age but you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram mother had to get you out the motherland to study that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand little does she know you're never coming back? she put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan he's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer fancy that, you came to london to get pimped by your uncle, damn  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  an angel will die covered in white closed eyes and hoping for a better life this time, we'll fade out tonight straight down the line  little lady, you're trembling with fear your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer you're sitting facing the detective, oh dear the meddling nurse couldn't just leave it she's only gone and made it much worse calling police and she'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused you're causing scandal going mad in the ward now the cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you the same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""who you working for?"" he's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore you're having a conversation you could be murdered for you're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court it's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own you've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe you reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat and then a voice says, ""where you been bitch? i wanna know"" no prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness you open the front door, he boots you in there's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error he towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight at this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye and in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece and dumps her body in the boot of his mercs in the street little lady left this earth in the worst way all because she got a card on her 13th birthday  and we're all under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and we don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly angels to die",-1.0,4.7,0.3639047955715288,0.6085902566037751,0.6373087339714383,0.8369073768714095,0.48072828579340016,0.6050498329617887,0.6856530725326495,0.6481226438669498,0.6016998384704387,0.6181486847746072,328.653

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in 
  
  
 When the darkness creeps in 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 And when my dreams are sleeping 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 Watching me 
  
  
 You better wake up cause I A.M making moves 
 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me 
  
  
 I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
 Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you?

 Glass on the side 
 I've been sat with you 
 For most of the night 
 Ignorin' everybody here 
 We wish they would disappear 
 So maybe we could get down now 
 And I don't wanna know 
 If you're gettin' ahead of the program 
 I want you to be mine, lady 
 To hold your body close 
 Take another step into the no-man's land 
 And for the longest time, lady 
  
  
 I need you darling 
 Come on, set the tone 
 If you feel you're fallin' 
 Won’t you let me know

 Come on, get involved 
 Feel it rushin' through you 
 From your head to toe

 This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage 
 And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days 
 Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know 
 But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke 
 Let it go until our roads are changed 
 Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave 
 No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say 
 But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray 
 I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you"" 
 Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila 
 I already know if she's a keeper 
 Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in 
 Deep shit if anybody finds out 
 I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now 
 Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch 
 One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

 And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell 
 Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer 
 Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder? 
 Under the covers where we used to lay 
 And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played 
 I'd be on tour almost every day 
 When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay 
 Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed 
 Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe 
 We used each other's air just for the people to see 
 And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 We go anywhere, our minds would take us 
 And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up 
 And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause 
 We can all be loved the way that God made us 
 And time's the only reason that we could break up 
 Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much 
 Distance is relative to the time that it takes 
 To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again 
  
  
 Oh Nina 
 You should go, Nina 
 Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now? 
 And I've been living on the road, Nina 
 But then again you should know, Nina 
 Cause that’s you and me both, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now, now? 
  
  
 And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie 
 With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 
 Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone 
 Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits 
 Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish 
 Back to the burrow with all the Celtics 
 I disappear, you call me selfish 
 I understand but I can’t help it 
 I put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back 
 Overlook the situation 
 Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
 And I'm not saying we should be taking a break 
 Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late 
 So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane 
 But in a day we'll have to say it again

 Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine 
 Disappearing all night 
 I don’t wanna know where he's been lying 
 I know what I wanna do 
 Wanna runaway, runaway with you 
 Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go 
  
  
 How long you leaving? 
 Well, Dad just don’t expect me back this evening 
 Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this 
 It’s been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but 
  
  
 I love him from my skin to my bones 
 But I don’t wanna live in his home 
 There’s nothing to say cause he knows

 I’ve never seen my dad cry 
 Cold as stone in the kitchen light

 If things change in a matter of days 
 I could be persuaded to hold on 
 Mama was the same 
 None of us are saints I guess that God knows that

 And one of these days I might just show that 
 Put my home in a suitcase 
 Tie both shoe laces, and hope that

 Just wish you'd never gone for the man 
 And waited two weeks at least 
 Before you let him take you 
 I stayed true, I kind of knew 
 You liked the dude from private school 
 He's waiting for the time to move 
 I knew he had his eyes on you 
 He's not the right guy for you 
 Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth 
 No, I would never lie to you 
 But it was never fine to lose you 
 And what a way to find out 
 It never came from my mouth 
 You never changed your mind 
 But you were just afraid to mind out 
 But  it 
 I won't be changing the subject, I love it 
 I'll make your little secret public 
 It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons 
 You sleep with in your closet to get back at me 
 Trapped and I'm lacking sleep 
 Fact is you're mad at me 
 Because I backtrack so casually 
 You're practically my family 
 If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be 
 But tragically our love just lost the will to live 
 But would I kill to give it one more shot? 
 I think not 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no 
 Anymore 
  
  
 Recently I tend to zone out 
 Up in my headphones to Holocene 
 You promised your body but I'm away so much 
 I stay more celibate than in a monastery 
 I'm not cut out for life on the road 
 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much 
 And at the time we'd just go, so sue me 
 I guess I'm not the man that you need 
 Ever since you went to uni 
 I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
 Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad 
 But when I broke the industry 
 That's when I broke your heart 
 I was supposed to chart and celebrate 
 But good things are over fast 
 I know it's hard to deal with and see this 
 I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
 Then I turn the music off 
 And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus 
 I never really want to believe this 
 Got advice from my dad and he 
 Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need 
 I guess I'm unaware of it 
 Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no 
 Anymore 
  
  
 And since you left, I've given up my days off 
 It's what I need to stay strong 
 I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 
 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 
 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could 
 The irony is if my career in music didn't exist 
 In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid 
 I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink 
 And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's 
 Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill 
 And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill 
 Go down in history as just a wasted talent 
 Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ? 
 It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me 
 Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be 
 Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this 
 These things happen for a reason and you can't change  
 Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty 
 But I had to get this off my chest

 I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know 
 You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in 
 I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden 
 Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision 
 Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism 
 Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen 
 Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven 
 And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager 
 I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather 
 I'll do my own thing now and get respect after 
 And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter 
 For four years I never had a place to stay 
 But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight 
 At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home 
 I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked 
 And went from sleeping at a subway station 
 To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population 
 Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax 
 Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 I take it back with the rhythm and blues 
 With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news 
 Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school 
 I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop 
 Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes 
 I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth 
 And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit 
 They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot 
 But then again that's what they're supposed to do 
 And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on"" 
 I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong 
 But then I've never had an enemy except the NME 
 But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be 
 With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
 Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree 
 Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids 
 I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic 
 I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it 
 This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 
 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless 
 And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed 
 Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus 
 Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton 
 Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless 
 Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 
 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written 
 Now absence can make your heart ache 
 But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state 
 Vividly, need to let my liver be 
 And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends 
 It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me 
 And I hope to see him blowing up globally 
 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally 
 It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but 
 But I just write schemes 
 I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans 
 Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely 
 You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates 
 Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made 
 And every single second knowing that we'll never betray 
 The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down 
 That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme 
 Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? 
 With this you must know that the numbers just sold 
 Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me 
 We forget 90 percent of it when we wake 
 But the other 10 percent, it never fades 
 Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads 
 Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade 
 Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more 
 A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought 
 You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors 
 Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour 
 Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit 
 You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick 
 I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss 
 And most of these other guys are kids that pose 
 His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is 
 Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it 
 Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower 
 You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band

 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese

 Slowly sinking, wasting 
 Crumbling like pastries

 'Cause we're just under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't want to go outside tonight 
 And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland 
 Or sells love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly

 Without you to hold I'll be freezing

 Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

 And I've got no plans for the weekend 
 So should we speak then? Keep it between friends? 
 Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to

 Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up 
 Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before 
 You don't hold me anymore

 And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place

 Could you make me a cup of tea 
 To open my eyes in the right way 
 And I know you love Shrek

 And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too 
 And if your DVD breaks today 
 You should've got a VCR 
 Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say

 And your brother always beats me 
 And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV

 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free

 I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones 
 Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum 
 It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots 
 What's better than thinking about the ones you love? 
 Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love

 Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up

 No one here to save the day now you're all alone

 I'm 31 now, I'm still saying ""Yes Nan"" 
 You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one 
 I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like 
 Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like 
 And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write 
 Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine 
 Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die 
 And when I'm gone I want my music to play 
 And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry

 Please, Father, let me go 
 As my mother sleeps 
  
  
 I don't know about James bond 
 But round here nobody lives twice 
 When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye 
 Cause only a judge can give you life 
 This is my advice 
 Trust me, I nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after I got this ride 
 Pissed like I had way too much wine 
 Wished I didn't get one 
 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this 
  
  
 I never had a playlist in my heart 
 Now I need an A list just to chart 
 But I've been famous from the start 
 How am I gonna make my mark? 
  
  
 Are you gonna play me though? 
 This song was never meant for the radio 
 (I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing 
 And I don't have time for a playlist) 
 How much will you pay me though 
 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there? 
 To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
 I am my music, my music is me 
 Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly 
 Angels to die","listen, little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, thursday you work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try and you remember that your punter went crazy last night you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for you'll make a trip to the whittington where they'll look at your jaw they'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure they'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door but young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  little lady, your mind you've made up your injuries you can't hide with make-up you need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just in case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb with any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip last year when your pimp just lost it he wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway cause all the heroin is making you age but you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram mother had to get you out the motherland to study that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand little does she know you're never coming back? she put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan he's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer fancy that, you came to london to get pimped by your uncle, damn  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  an angel will die covered in white closed eyes and hoping for a better life this time, we'll fade out tonight straight down the line  little lady, you're trembling with fear your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer you're sitting facing the detective, oh dear the meddling nurse couldn't just leave it she's only gone and made it much worse calling police and she'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused you're causing scandal going mad in the ward now the cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you the same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""who you working for?"" he's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore you're having a conversation you could be murdered for you're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court it's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own you've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe you reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat and then a voice says, ""where you been bitch? i wanna know"" no prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness you open the front door, he boots you in there's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error he towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight at this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye and in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece and dumps her body in the boot of his mercs in the street little lady left this earth in the worst way all because she got a card on her 13th birthday  and we're all under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and we don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly angels to die",-1.0,4.7,0.3639047955715288,0.6085902566037751,0.6373087339714383,0.8369073768714095,0.48072828579340016,0.6050498329617887,0.6856530725326495,0.6481226438669498,0.6016998384704387,0.6181486847746072,328.653

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in 
  
  
 When the darkness creeps in 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 And when my dreams are sleeping 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 Watching me 
  
  
 You better wake up cause I A.M making moves 
 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me 
  
  
 I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
 Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you?

 The sun had just dawned in 
 My bed, or your bed 
 Was the first or the last time 
 I don't care, it feels right 
 I'm not, not stopping all night 
 Things fall apart and in a part you feel distant 
 Reactions are instant if emotions are constant 
 Let's say for instance that you had a conscience 
 Would you take the time then to weigh out the options 
  
  
 All that, all that 
 You can give me all that 
 All that, all that

 Have I crossed the lines 
 Or is there more to find, more to find? 
 I think inside immortalized 
 Mortalized, more to life

 Like Optimus Prime in his prime 
 Kick it, don't skip it, to the finish line

 A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality

 And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine 
 But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now 
 Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself 
 And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria 
 I only wanna die some days 
  
  
 Someday, someday, when I burst into flames 
 I'll leave you the dust, my love 
 Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the 
 Days when we came to this place

 Is it really that strange if I always wanna change? 
 And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely 
 I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces 
 Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break 
 Who will fill the empty space? So... 
  
  
 Now, if I figure this out 
 Apart from my beating heart 
 It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the 
 Weight of the choices I've made 
 I told you I'd ride this out 
 It's gettin' harder every day 
 Somehow, I'm burstin' out of myself

 You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'm being dead serious (I gotta see this birth certificate) 
 Okay, I'll prove it 
  
  
 Well, who am I? I'm almost 25 
 Can't remember half the time that I've been alive 
 'Cause half was in a cheap apartment 
 And half was on the Eastside (Eastside) 
 They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos 
 And God knows that they were right 
 Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you 
 Then put you on a feature on the B-Side 
 And who do you call when it's late at night? 
 When the headlines just don't paint the picture right 
 When you look at yourself on a screen and say 
 ""Oh my God, there's no way that's me"" 
 And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried 
 And I bought another house, and I never go outside 
 And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit 
 Well, she told me 
 She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die 
 'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied 
 And I remember the names of every single kid I've met 
 But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed 
 And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee 
 And hoped that my father would finally call me 
 And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours 
 And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower 
 Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder 
 But then I realize that I'm no higher power 
 That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now 
 And I'm so happy I figured that out 
 I've got a long way to go until self-preservation 
 Think my moral compass is on a vacation 
 And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation 
 I'm still looking for my salvation 
  
  
 Soft and slow, watch the minutes go 
 Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself 
 Watch the minutes go 
 Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself 
  
  
 I think I have a confession to make, I feel like (So we know you don't) 
 I need to say that I was really born at 9:26 
 It's on my birth certificate, I'm a liar

 And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd 
 In the background screaming, ""Everybody, look at me""

 All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign

 I stole a bit of my mother's perfume? 
 'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall 
 That separated the dining room 
 And I remember the fear in your eyes 
 The very first time we snuck into the city pool 
 Late December, with my heart in my chest 
 And the clouds of my breath 
 Didn't know where we were running to 
 But don't look back 
  
  
 Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights 
 'Til our wide eyes burn blind 
 We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through 
 To the bottom of the line

 On a Roman holiday 
  
  
 Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens? 
 'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat 
 I imagine the tears in your eyes 
 The very first night I'll sleep without you 
 And when it happens I'll be miles away

 King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland 
 King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again 
 King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin' 
 King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin' 
 King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed 
 King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect 
 King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it 
 King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction 
 King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated 
 King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken 
 King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse 
 King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice 
 King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion 
  
  
 Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision 
 I embrace them with collision, kings did it 
 King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king! 
 I dropped a million tears 
 I know several responsibilities put me here 
 I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned 
 The lens that I'm lookin' through 
 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free 
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas 
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me 
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace 
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef 
 What do you stand for? 
 Are you a activist? What are your city plans for? 
 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way? 
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say 
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'? 
  
  
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open? 
 Because the king don't cry, king don't die 
 King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall 
 Kingdom come, when I come, you know why

 They don't wanna see me livin' on the end 
 Of the city in a citywide bend 
 Show no pity in the city full of sin

 Young Millie Jackson back to the shit 
 Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory 
 Stack bodies, not figurines 
 Move beneath the surface, submarine 
 I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword 
 Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward 
 What you standing on the side for? 
 Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg 
 Spit slick, attack is subliminal 
 Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister 
 Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal 
 Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep* 
 Crushing any system, that belittles us 
 Antidote to every poison they administer 
 Switch it like time signatures 
 Colors in my aura tend cover the perimeter 
 Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through 
 Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom) 
 Wool over your eyes 
 My strength ain't nothing like my size

 Tangle my cords like a weaver

 I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer? 
 What the fuck happened? (Oh no!) 
 I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars 
 Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)

 You goat-mouth mammyfucker 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help 
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!"" 
 I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too 
 Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo! 
 Aw, yeah, fuck the judge 
 I made it past twenty-five, and there I was 
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him 
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
 Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"" 
 Limo tinted with the gold plates 
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

 Get it back 
 I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it

 If I was the president 
 I'd pay my mama's rent

 Life to me, like a box of chocolate 
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it 
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
 K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged 
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards 
 You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses 
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me 
  
  
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
  
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, God bless the kid 
 Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 
  
  
 ""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips 
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor 
 Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for 
 Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this? 
 One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist 
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him 
 Quickly because he got it 
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds? 
 No more livin' poor, meet my four-four 
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
 But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey 
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
 Well, that's me at these awards"" 
 I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
 She said...

 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga

 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, dazed and confused 
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
 You can take your boy out the hood 
 But you can't take the hood out the homie 
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

 (Woman moaning) 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk- 
 Sex 
  
  
 She just want to close her eyes and sway 
 With you, with you, with you 
 Exercise her right to work it out 
 It's true, it's true, it's true 
 Shout out to the birthday girls 
 Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl) 
 Everyone deserves a night to play (Play) 
 She plays, only when you tell her no 
  
  
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
  
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good 
 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me, I’m just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I’m here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around, demolition might crush 
  
  
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
  
 If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep 
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I’ve been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
 I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em 
 I’d rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush 
  
  
 If these walls could talk 
 I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you 
 If these walls could talk 
 I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it 
  
  
  
  
 If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late 
 Your destiny, accept it, your fate 
 Burn accessories and stash them on the yard 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening, no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper 
 Walls can talk (Talk) 
  
  
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusin' your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same

 I place blame on you still, place shame on you still 
 Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel 
 Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors 
 Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours 
 But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special 
 What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several 
 Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin' 
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience? 
 Where was your antennas? 
 Where was the influence you speak of? 
 You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her 
 I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader! 
 I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you! 
 The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
 Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication 
 Thought money would change you 
 Made you more complacent 
 I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it 
 I swear—

 You the reason why mama and them leavin' 
 No, you ain't shit, you say you love them I know you don't mean it 
 I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
 Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
 Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
 You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend? 
 You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend 
 A friend never leave Compton for profit 
 Or leave his best friend, little brother 
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
 Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches 
 You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven 
 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit 
 Guess you thought he would recover well 
 Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
 Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed"" 
 You ain't try 
  
  
 I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga 
 I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga 
 I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga 
 Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga 
 And if this bottle could talk,  
 I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault 
 Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
 Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
 I know your secrets, don't let me tell them to the world 
 About that shit you thinkin' and that time you  
 I'm 'bout to hurl, I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you 
 You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof 
 Should've killed yo' ass a long time ago 
 You should've feeled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
 And if those mirrors could talk it'd say, ""You gotta go"" 
 And if I told your secrets the world'll know money

 But homicide be looking at you from the face down 
 What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down? 
 Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life 
 Painkillers only put me in the twilight 
 Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight 
 Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows 
 Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me 
 Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven 
 No preliminary hearings on my record 
 I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh 
 Tell the world I know it's too late 
 Boys and girls, I think I gone cray 
 Drown inside my vices all day 
 Won't you please believe when I say

 Nigga, when our pride was low 
 Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

 Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'

 My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

 What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car? 
 40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar? 
 Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog 
 Motherfucker, you can live at the mall 
 I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal 
 I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero 
 Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal 
 Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you 
 Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you 
 In the presence of your chico... Ah! 
 I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel 
 If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you 
 Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all 
 Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all 
 I rap, I black on track so rest assured 
 My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

 Too afraid of a lot of changes 
 I'm alright, and you're a favorite 
 Dark nights in my prayers 
  
  
 I remembered you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression

 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west) 
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west) 
 Been in it before internet had new acts 
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack 
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision 
 Kendrick is master that mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
 Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque

 I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health 
 I know fatality might haunt you

 I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious 
 I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors 
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
 I know everything, I know history 
 I know the universe works mentally 
 I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money 
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery 
 I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies 
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District 
 Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed 
 I know how people work 
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth 
 I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget

 The day I came home

 I met a little boy that resembled my features 
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
 Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted 
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
 He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language 
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous 
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken 
 But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it 
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor 
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 And that was bullshit 
 I know your life is full of turmoil 
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you 
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two 
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace 
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially 
 To come back home""

 I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react 
 Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto 
 When I was seventeen with the .38 Special 
 Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real 
 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
 Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway

 Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga 
 Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game 
 You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game 
 Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up 
 Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up 
 Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock 
 It goes ""Sherm Sticks, burn this"" 
 That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix 
 50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
 El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers 
 Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you

 Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
 Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
 Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer 
 Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town 
 From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around 
 Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans 
 Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'? 
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
 Make it they promise to fuck with you 
 No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""

 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
 Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black 
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin' 
 Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
 Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
 Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows 
 No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues 
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
 I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
 Had the Coast on standby 
 “K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box” 
 I box ‘em all in, by a landslide 
 Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
 I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
 But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
 He said ""it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"" 
  
  
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo- 
  
  
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
 I didn't want to self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
 Going back and forth 
 Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war 
 Back in the city

 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
 ""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 20 years ago, can't forget 
 Now I can lend him a ear or two 
 How to stack these residuals tenfold 
 The liberal concept of what men'll do 
 ""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
 My American tongue was leery 
 Walked out the gas station 
 A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion 
 Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land 
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
 He begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
 Told him, ""Beat it"" 
 Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it 
 He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
 Nothin' less, nothin' more"" 
 I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost? 
  
  
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
  
 He's starin' at me in disbelief 
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave 
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 Like I was supposed to save him 
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
 And this particular person just had it down pat 
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 ""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? 
 A humble man is all that we ever need"" 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost? 
  
  
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
  
 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
 I never met a transient that demanded attention 
 They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
 So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum 
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines 
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
 I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind 
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend 
 I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin 
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' 
 I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal 
 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre 
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
 He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet"" 
 I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep"" 
 He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free 
 You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power 
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit 
 The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"" 
  
  
 I washed my hands, I said my grace 
 What more do you want from me?

 Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
 Sneak (dissin') 
 Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga

 So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
 Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
 Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
 By different shades of faces 
 Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation"" 
 It all came from God, then you was my confirmation 
 I came to where you reside 
 And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes

 I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!) 
  
  
 Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac 
 Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy 
 Color of your skin? Color of your eyes 
 That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby 
 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey 
 All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave 
 12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark 
 I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas 
 Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid 
 And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!” 
 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored 
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times 
 If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
 It ain’t complex to put it in context 
 Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
 Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
 Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be 
 I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey 
 I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens 
 And spike your self-esteem 
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me 
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
 And it’s all beautiful to me 
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing 
  
  
 Barefoot babies with no cares

 Six in the morn', fire in the street 
 Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see

 It's such a shame they may call me crazy 
 They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin' 
 But homie, you made me 
 Black don't crack, my nigga 
  
  
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
 Pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me don't you? 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You're fuckin' evil 
 I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
  
  
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
  
  
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back 
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block 
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat 
  
  
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
 That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
 Curse me till I'm dead 
 Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head 
 Institutionalized manipulation and lies 
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 You hate me don't you? 
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
 Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
 Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you? 
 How can I tell you I'm making a killin'? 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree 
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
 It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
 Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
 That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
 You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
 I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle 
 Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
 Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
 Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score 
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
 Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers"" 
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
 Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
 Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street 
 When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

 Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way) 
 Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon 
 Is the mic on or not? I want the mic 
 We're bringing up nobody, nobody... 
 Nobody but the number one rapper in the world 
 He done traveled all over the world 
 He came back just to give you some game 
 All of the little boys and girls, come up here 
 (One two, one two, what's happening, fool?) 
 Come right here, this is for you, come on up 
 Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother 
 I done been through a whole lot 
 Trial, tribulation, but I know God 
 The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie 
 Pray that the holy water don't go dry 
 As I look around me 
 So many motherfuckers wanna down me 
 But an enemigo never drown me 
 In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me 
  
  
 And (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police 
 (I love myself) 
 Illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy 
 (I love myself) 
 One day at a time 
  
  
 They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street 
 Gun in the hood, mob of police 
 Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend 
 And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh 
 These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front) 
 I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis 
 Dreams of reality's peace 
 Blow steam in the face of the beast 
 Sky could fall down, wind could cry now 
 Look at me motherfucker I smile- 
  
  
 And (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?

 Illuminated— 
 All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front 
 (I love myself) 
 Baby what about you, come on 
  
  
 (Crazy, what you gon' do?) 
 Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up 
 (Haunt you) 
 Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart 
 On my sleeve, let the runway start 
 You know the miserable do love company 
 What do you want from me and my scars? 
 Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence 
 How many times my potential was anonymous? 
 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this, nigga 
  
  
 (I love myself) 
 When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see? 
 (I love myself) 
 Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

 I went to war last night 
 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic 
 I'ma do it till I get it right 
 I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night) 
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message 
 I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave 
 From a negative and letting them annihilate me 
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed 
 Finna run into a building, lay my body...

 The judge make time so it ain’t shit 
 It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog

 All my niggas listen, listen to this: 
  
  
 I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga"" 
 He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas"" 
 No better than Samuel on the Django 
 No better than a white man with slave boats"" 
 Sound like I needed some soul searching 
 My Pops gave me some game in real person 
 Retraced my steps on what they never taught me 
 Did my homework fast before government caught me 
 So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah 
 On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us 
 So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us 
 Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia 
 N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen 
 N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish 
 The history books overlook the word and hide it 
 America tried to make it to a house divided 
 The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong 
 So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song 
 N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more 
 Black stars can come and get me 
 Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
 If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
 Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? 
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? 
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome 
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing 
 But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that— 
  
  
 Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
 You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur? 
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt? 
 You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? 
 Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time? 
 Like, who got your best interest? 
 Like, how much are you dependent? 
 How clutch are the people that say they love you? 
 And who pretending? 
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in? 
 Do you show forgiveness? 
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? 
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? 
 What kind of bridge did they burn? 
 Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned 
 You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
 You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom 
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
 That considered the blessing of everyone 
 This your lesson for everyone, say; 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin' 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga— 
  
  
 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you 
 That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson 
 I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is 
 So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me? 
 Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be? 
 See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
 Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law 
 Generation X—will I ever be your ex? 
 Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause 
 Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all 
 It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
 How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
 Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
 Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin 
 Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga 
  
  
 ""I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn’t wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city 
 I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man 
 Maybe I’m just another nigga” 
  
 Shit and that’s all I wrote 
 I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain’t really a poem 
 I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to 
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you 
 I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- 
 About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground 
 What you mean by that, what the ground represent? 
  
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil 
 Right 
 That’s how I see it, my word is bond 
 I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people 
 Right 
 The poor people is gonna open up this whole world 
 And swallow up the rich people 
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat 
 And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing 
 The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like 
 You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be... 
 There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- 
 They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying? 
  
 Aight so let me ask you this then 
 Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich 
 Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? 
  
 I see myself as a natural born hustler 
 A true hustler in every sense of the word 
 I took nothin’, I took the opportunities 
 I worked at the most menial and degrading job 
 And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it 
 I went from having somebody managing me 
 To me hiring the person that works my management company 
 I changed everything, I realized my destiny 
 In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people 
 Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made millions for the record companies 
 I made millions for these movie companies 
 Now I make millions for, for us 
  
 And through your different avenues of success 
 How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 
  
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game 
 And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true"" 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying? 
 And it was happening to me for a reason 
 You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit 
 I was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 So it’s no problem, you know 
 I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know 
 I’m finna go straight through 
  
 Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that 
 Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 
  
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance 
 And not only me but, it goes down my family tree 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back 
  
 Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like 
 ""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win 
 And I wanna lay it all down"" 
  
 In this country, a black man only have like 
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength 
 And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong 
 While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 
 'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like 
 They take the heart and soul out of a man 
 Out of a black man, in this country 
 And you don’t wanna fight no more 
 And if you don’t believe me, you can look around 
 You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers 
  
 That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings 
 Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that 
 There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you 
 What you think is the future for me and my generation today? 
  
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores 
 And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed 
 For real, I don’t think America know that 
 I think America think we was just playing 
 And it’s gonna be some more playing but 
 It ain’t gonna be no playing 
 It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying? 
 It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen 
  
 That’s crazy man, in my opinion 
 Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations 
 Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know 
 Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic 
 And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out 
 Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes 
  
 Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’ 
 We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 
 Damn 
  
 I wanted to read one last thing to you 
 It’s actually something a good friend had wrote 
 Describing my world, it says: 
 “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it 
 In order to protect itself from this mad city 
 While consuming its environment 
 The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him 
 But praises the butterfly 
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness 
 And the beauty within the caterpillar 
 But having a harsh outlook on life 
 The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak 
 And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 Already surrounded by this mad city 
 The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon 
 Which institutionalizes him 
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 He’s trapped 
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as 
 Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 The result? 
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations 
 That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle 
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different 
 They are one and the same"" 
 What’s your perspective on that?

 Respect my mind or die from lead shower 
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours 
  
  
 Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix 
 My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation 
 Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin' 
 Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked 
 And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas 
 Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this 
 Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken 
 All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

 I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir 
 Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher 
 And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure 
 And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed 
 And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record 
 That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her 
 She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin' 
 This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

 And I run at ho with a baton 
 That's a relay race with a bouquet 
 They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines."" 
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way 
 Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay 
 I'm never livin' life confined 
 As I feel you even if I'm blind 
 I can tell you who, what, when, where 
 How to sell your game right on time

 Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ 
 Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat

 Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down 
 And listen to this true mothafuckin' story 
 Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch 
  
  
 Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really I'm a sober soul 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And we ain't askin' for no favors 
 Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really, I'm a peacemaker 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you) 
 One day it's gon' burn you 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
  
  
  
  
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota 
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda 
 Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up 
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor 
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble 
 I hope the universe love you today 
 'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away 
 A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate 
 If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted 
 Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent 
 The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it 
 Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses 
 Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls 
 And asked them what they workin' with 
 Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth 
 Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies 
  
  
 Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red 
 Come through and bust ya head, nigga! 
 Me and the homies 
 Sag all the way to the liquor store 
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more 
 Me and the homies 
 I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas 
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in 
 Me and the homies 
 Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka 
 And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!” 
  
  
 It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin' 
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin' 
 Hungry for anything unhealthy 
 And if nutrition can help me 
 I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin' 
 We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester 
 You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses 
 Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there 
 'Cause every time we down there 
 We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards 
 Bougie bitches with no extensions 
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination 
 Before we sparked a conversation 
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like 
 Then started interrogatin' 
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean 
 I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it 
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it 
 That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent 
 Until I'm with the homies 
  
  
 (Just ridin', just ridin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Bullshittin', actin' a fool) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Trippin', really trippin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin') 
  
  
 Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had 
 A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad 
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma 
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya 
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience 
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in 
 But Jeezy still playin' 
 And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?"" 
 Pull in front of the house 
 That we been campin' out for like two months 
 The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want 
  
  
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
 Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room! 
 Wait, what?! 
 Nigga, there's somebody in this room! 
  
  
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo 
 DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk 
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right 
 Then made a left, we was just circlin' life 
 My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it."" 
 I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense 
 With the homies 
 But – they made a right, then made a left 
 Then made a right, then another right 
 One lucky night with the homies 
  
  
 K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
 Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded 
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though 
 Ooh, which one? 
 Well, which one he talkin' about? 
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it 
 I pray he ain't hit that 
 Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one 
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! 
 Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe 
 Nigga, for what? 
 What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
 ""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"" 
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there 
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street 
 There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go 
 Look, here's the plan, luv 
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park 
 'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight 
 That's what he's not gon' do 
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30 
 That's straight, but we should meet up around 12 
 I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too 
 Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down! 
 Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!

 Santa Claus don't miss them stockings 
 Liquors spillin', pistols poppin' 
 Bakin' soda YOLA whippin' 
 Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin' 
 My homeboy just dome'd a nigga 
 I just hope the Lord forgive him 
 Pots with cocaine residue 
 Every day I'm hustlin' 
 What else is a thug to do 
 When you eatin' cheese from the government? 
 Gotta provide for my daughter n'em 
 Get the fuck up out my way, bish 
 Got that drum and I got them bands 
 Just like a parade, bish 
 Drop that work up in the bushes 
 Hope them boys don't see my stash 
 If they do, tell the truth 
 This the last time you might see my ass 
 From the gardens where the grass ain't cut 
 Them serpents lurkin', Blood 
 Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs 
 But it's all good 
 Broken promises, steal your watch 
 And tell you what time it is 
 Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is 
 In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees 
 Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree 
  
  
 It go Halle Berry or hallelujah

 Man, I swear that she can get it 
 Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high 
 Hands up high, hands up high 
 Tell 'em dim the lights down right now 
 Put me in the mood 
 I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go 
  
  
 I recognize your fragrance 
 Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit 
 Uh, and I know your taste is 
 A little bit, hmm, high maintenance 
 Uh, everybody else basic 
 You live life on an everyday basis 
 With poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when 
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen 
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em? 
 I really wanna know you all 
 I really wanna show you off 
 Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne 
 Cold nights when you curse this name 
 You called up your girlfriends 
 And y'all curled in that little bitty Range 
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party 
 Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari 
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry 
 They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell 
 But I could never right my wrongs

 I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience 
 With all these seductive photographs 
 And all these one-off vacations you've been takin' 
 Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense 
 Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man 
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane 
 Take you and your momma to the motherland 
 I could do it, maybe one day 
 When you figure out you're gonna need someone 
 When you figure out it's alright here in the city 
 And you don't run from where we come from 
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice 
 You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex 
 Your natural hair and your soft skin 
 And your big ass in that sundress, ooh 
 Good God, what you doin' that walk for? 
 When I see that thing move 
 I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more 
 They say communication save relations, I can tell 
 But I can never right my wrongs 
 Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

 Every time I write these words they become a taboo 
 Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true 
 Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof 
 I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe 
 Call me crazy, we can both be insane 
 A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain 
 I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve 
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it 
 Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat 
 It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh 
 Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines

 Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray 
 Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away 
 I should ask a choir: ""What do you require 
 To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"" 
 As the record spin I should pray 
 For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey

 I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin' 
 Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue 
 And you understand that I ain't 
 But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble 
 And live in the street with rank 
 No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study 
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
 From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang

 Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help 
 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until 
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will 
 It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still 
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill 
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill 
 All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere 
 As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue 
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof 
 And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo 
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through 
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile 
 I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down 
 Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest 
 He don't mind, he know we'll never respect

 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell 
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell 
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill 
 You're living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A never relay a guarantee 
 And plan C never could say just what it was 
 And your plans only can pan around love 
 You love him, you love them, you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen"" 
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
 You love French tip and trip that pay for 
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more 
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt

 Your eyes never lie, even if they fell 
 Out the sky and your optics turn stale 
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill 
 Of living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A only can make another mistake 
 And you can't see success coming from plan C 
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely 
 And love them and love when you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old 
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control 
 Of everything that you love, you love beef 
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police 
 You love your hood, might even love it to death 
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

 The reason why I know you very well 
 Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? 
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal 
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal 
 When living in a world that come with plan B 
 A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free 
 And plan C just an excuse like ""because"" 
 Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love? 
 I love them, I love when I love her 
 I love so much, I love when love hurts 
 I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract 
 I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack 
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch 
 I love what the both of you have to offer 
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else 
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself 
 To the point I should hate everything I do love? 
 Should I hate living my life inside the club? 
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? 
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? 
 Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""? 
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about 
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will 
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

 This is King Kendrick Lamar 
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw 
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it 
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us 
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor 
 And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning 
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing 
 And if they take everything, know I got 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga 
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic 
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging 
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap 
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month 
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman 
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga 
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga 
 Kendrick Conan nigga 
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that 
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters 
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that 
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats 
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats 
  
  
 Will swarm on me like a beehive 
 Hop in the G ride 
 From the West to the East side 
 Know that's just how Compton roll 
  
  
 And that's a given 
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision 
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes 
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it 
 Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business 
 I blow up every time we throw up a record 
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion 
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So tell that gangster throw his set high 
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high 
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly 
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I 
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye 
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive 
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye 
 Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Now we can all celebrate 
 We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA 
 America target our rap market, as controversy and hate 
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate 
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich 
 And the broke niggas that play 
 With them gorillas that know killers 
 That know where you stay 
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé 
 This was brought to you by Dre 
 Now every motherfucker in here say: 
 ""Look who's responsible 
 For taking Compton international 
 I make 'em holla"" 
  
  
 Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie 
 Just Blaze 
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah 
 In the city of Compton 
 Ain't no city quite like mine

 But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though 
 My newest girl from back home got issues with parents 
 And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris? 
 Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen 
 So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance

 Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive 
 Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside

 My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive 
 And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna 
 We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer 
 And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass

 Man, you know I had to— 
  
  
 Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me 
 I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me 
 I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives 
 And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by 
 Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil 
 You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you 
 All loyal so you keep eggin' me on 
 And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm 
 Last night I tried some raw oysters 
 Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit 
 That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit 
 That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written 
 That boy did it on purpose 
 That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you 
 You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after 
 And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper 
 Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga 
 I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger 
 Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk 
 Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home 
 I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town 
 You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around 
 But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down 
 Go in the booth and lay a body down 
 Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi 
 Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby 
 And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll 
 Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so"" 
 See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco 
 No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though 
 I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow 
 We all do it for the art so I could never hate though 
 Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load 
 How the game turn into the Drake show? 
 Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go? 
 Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action 
 And then you never notice they missin' 
 On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district 
 Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah 
 I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya 
 You know I had to do it for ya 
 You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end 
 So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

 All you self-promoters are janky 
 We established like the Yankees 
 This whole fuckin' game thankless 
 We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin' 
 No limit to where I can take it 
 And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper 
 I thought we looked out for one another 
 Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble 
 I guess it's different in the city I come from 
 All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me 
 They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me 
 The higher I get, the less they accept me 
 Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha 
 No way out 'cause I'm already in it 
 I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket 
 Good business can clean millions, I got the vision 
 I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons"" 
 Even back when I wasn't as poppin' 
 When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road 
 And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky 
 I tried to make the right choices with the world watching 
 ""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"" 
 Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life 
 And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah 
 Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child 
 Can't nobody hold me down 
 Especially not right now 
 Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile 
 Take that, take that 
 No love in they heart so they fake that 
 DiCaprio level the way they play that 
 Damn, nigga, what is that? 
 Y'all don't hear no songs 
 They hit my phone like, ""You did that"" 
 They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?"" 
 It's always on some shit like 
 ""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?"" 
 Like I'm about to tell you where she been at 
 Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped 
 She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry 
 Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari 
 All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY 
 She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys 
 My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari 
 Look, now you got me started 
 I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley 
 I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist 
 Always gotta play it smarter 
 Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup 
 Cameras pointing every time I look up 
 That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up 
 Sponsorship dollars is sky high 
 He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"" 
 Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high 
 Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday 
 Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance 
 Yeah, redoin' the entrance 
 Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit 
 And you still never quite get it 
 Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this 
 Yeah, I make you dance to this 
 I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder 
 Sun shinin', waxed tires 
 See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave 
 The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face 
 Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake 
 For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe 
 Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays 
 These guys move so greezy nowadays 
 I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it 
 Save my stories for down the line 
 I'm too ahead of the curve every time 
 Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV 
 'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

 This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know? 
 For my niggas, though 
  
  
 Uh, you underestimated greatly 
 Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me? 
 The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me 
 So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety 
 I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards 
 Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper 
 Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter 
 Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga 
 Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya 
 I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya? 
 Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget 
 Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it 
 Damn, this shit could go on a tape 
 Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break 
 Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook 
 That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake 
 Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me? 
 Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team 
 'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas 
 Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas 
 For real, some nobody started feelin' himself 
 A couple somebodies started killin' themself 
 A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf 
 I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help 
 I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation 
 Bad press during the summer over allegations 
 I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money 
 That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming 
 A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement 
 And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear 
 Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga 
 Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous 
 Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans 
 But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses 
 And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans 
 Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings 
 Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's 
 Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco 
 This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon 
 This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real 
 All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills 
 Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil 
 Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill 
 If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real 
 Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase 
 But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates 
 My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race 
 It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe 
 Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10 
 Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again 
 I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again 
 A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up? 
  
  
 Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again 
 If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in

 Why you never come to where I stay? 
 Always hiding out in your New York condo 
 Why you never come to where I stay? 
 If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know 
 Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship? 
 Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense 
 Why are we focused on things 
 That don't even mean nothing, girl? 
 Why can we not find the time 
 And sit down and discuss it, girl? 
 Let me at least tell you my side of things, man 
 Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man 
  
  
 Me and you are playing house 
 Start thinking that I'm losing touch 
 Got a tight grip on you now 
 Maybe I should loosen up 
 When I leave you and I go home 
 I start forgetting what it is 
 Start to think I got to get it how I live 
 We too busy for a wedding or a kid 
 If I'm working then I know you working 
 Keep in touch with other women 
 'Cause you make me nervous 
 I empower girls that don't deserve it 
 I don't mean to do that shit on purpose 
 It's just that when I go home 
 I start forgetting what it is 
 The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6 
  
  
 And you don't ever come to where I stay at 
 You just rather stay up in your New York condo 
 You don't ever come to where I stay at

 Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship? 
 You know how sticky these situations get 
 You go up higher than me some days

 Your new shit sound like you do covers 
 Of all of my old shit, oh shit 
 I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed 
 Swear you niggas is hopeless 
 I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning 
 On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip 
 I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them 
 Drizzy still got some '06 in him 
 IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on 
 All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on 
 It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game 
 See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane 
 Pay yourself and owe yourself 
 Before you come to my city just know yourself 
 Know where you at 
 I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at 
 The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga 
  
  
 But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is 
 That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like 
 The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just.. 
 Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all 
 We went through errythang... 
 I remember you loved Jodeci 
 I mean like studied, you even made me a CD… 
  
  
 Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out 
 I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op 
 We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop 
 Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC 
 I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not 
 I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot 
 Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga 
 I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas 
 Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga 
 I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas 
 You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga 
 I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga 
 Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails 
 And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel 
 That five star in your city, they know where we at 
 I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga 
  
  
 Jodeci's back 
 You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back 
 I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none 
 The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga 
 (Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms) 
 Jodeci's back 
 Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back 
 I paint pictures and flip words 
 Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole) 
  
  
 Roof top, hoes turnt up 
 Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up 
 Wonder where she is, fuck could she be? 
 She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak 
 Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak 
 Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me 
 Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas 
 Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas 
 Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain 
 Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame 
 Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame 
 'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no 
 Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters 
 I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest 
 Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started 
 I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ******** 
 Hold your applause 
 Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards? 
 David and Goliath, takin' on the giants 
 No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole 
 No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars 
 Tappin' into '94 Nas 
 Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre 
 Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy 
 Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours 
 Just to get their dollar signed 
 Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin' 
 Trenchcoat flow, bottom line 
 To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine 
 Flow dumber than your projections 
 This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet 
 Your covers keep perplexin' me 
 Maybe it's too complex for me 
 But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales? 
 'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me 
 You legends know that we rap

 They say that all your old girls got somebody new 
 I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"" 
 They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go"" 
 It's nothing personal 
 It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though 
 They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up 
 With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore 
 They might have loved you before 
 But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"" 
 Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere 
 It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year 
 She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"" 
 Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now 
 Uh, but believe I remember it all 
  
  
 I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit 
 No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit 
 No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss 
 And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit 
 Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun 
 They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come 
 I'm never scared, they never real, I never run 
 When all is said and done, more is always said than done 
 And I was told once, things will change 
 By a nigga named Tip when my deal came 
 Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange 
 Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names 
 Rochelle, Jordan 
 Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand 
 How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth? 
 How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth? 
 Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all 
 Remember how I used to feel at the start of it 
 And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale 
 And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it 
 Yeah, just lie to my ears 
 Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear 
 Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas 
 And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now 
 Uh, but believe I remember it all 
  
  
 My mother is back to who she was years ago 
 It's like a new page me and her are beginning on 
 I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand 
 'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on 
 She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth 
 But I'd never break the promises I made to myself 
 And I would never make up names for myself 
 Then change the names that I just gave to myself 
 Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?"" 
 I used to brag about it to my friends 
 And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat 
 And maybe that's all they do is just pretend 
 Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it 
 Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it 
 Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love 
 'Cause I thought it was all I needed 
 Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along 
 And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit 
 They trip off the amount of people that I brought along 
 But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit 
 Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids 
 I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live 
 I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did 
 Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now 
 Uh, but believe I remember it all 
  
  
 Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know? 
 But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel

 I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta 
 Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned 
 Bitches, what's up with ya? 
 I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it 
 I took some sense and made a nickel of it 
 I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers 
 With those lips that all that lipstick covers 
 You're never too grown up to miss and hug her 
 And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers 
 I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers 
 This ain't the life that I'm used to 
 Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to 
 Did you forget me? 
 Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me 
 And fear that I won't remember? 
 I wish you could still accept me for me 
 I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad 
 The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have 
 I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags 
 Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd 
 In one nigga, amazing shit 
 I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit 
 I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit 
 And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit 
 Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains? 
 The seats for these Heat games? 
 I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things 
 La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed 
 To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up? 
 Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices 
 23 and going through a midlife crisis 
 But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife 
 And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it 
 Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach 
 To be far from hood, but to understand the streets 
 I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech 
 Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach 
 Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it 
 Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment 
 And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

 The young spitter that everybody in rap fear 
 A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year 
 The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier 
 Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed 
 Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head 
 Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me 
 'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD 
 Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it

 And my mother tried to run away from home 
 But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway 
 And she cried to me, so I cried too 
 And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"" 
 And 40, that was all before I showed up 
 And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up 
 Damn, my reality just set in 
 And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in 
 I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in 
 So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end 
 My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow

 Wise words from a decent man 
 Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand 
 This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan 
 And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man 
 In-person I am everything and more 
 I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before 
 But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore 
 I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store 
 Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy"" 
 Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"" 
 And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy 
 While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy 
 I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad

 One time for the homie DJ Screw 
 Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch 
  
  
 Up so high even when I'm coming down 
 Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town 
 I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer 
 Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah 
 Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man 
 I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can 
 She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it 
 'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it 
  
  
 And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter 
 And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner 
 Airport stunting, flying charters overseas 
 Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's 
 Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone 
 But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone 
 So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone 
 And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on 
  
  
 I don't give you the time you deserve from me 
 This is something I know, I know, I know 
 So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston 
 Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow 
 But I do it to her 
  
  
 Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout 
 3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot 
 It's on once again and I never pretend 
 A nigga staying G 'til the end 
  
  
 Ayy, yeah 
 I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know 
 I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston 
 Candy paint switching colors in the light 
 It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city 
 Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke 
 It feel like, like everything's just moving slow

 It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking 
 I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet 
 But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out 
 Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is 
  
  
 Uh, look, I'm the property of October 
 I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured 
 Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over 
 I think better when I'm not sober 
 I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder 
 Private flights back home, no stop over 
 Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over 
 The shit my mother look shocked over 
 Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven 
 A migraine, take two Excedrin 
 I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven 
 And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second 
 I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard 
 And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars 
 Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours 
 ‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star 
 I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane 
 Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name 
 One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change 
 And show me the city that I without fear claim 
 What I set seems to never extinguish 
 Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish 
 Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers 
 My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer 
 Heh, or alarm, or whatever 
 She be here at six in the morn' if I let her 
 But I never get attracted to fans 
 'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam 
 I always knew that I could figure 
 How to get these label heads to offer him good figures 
 And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous 
 'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas 
 It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over 
 Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over 
 Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker 
 I'll slow roast ya, got no holster 
 Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster 
 Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster 
 G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker 
 They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker 
 I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier 
 My cup runneth over 
 The same niggas I ball with, I fall with 
 On some southern drawl shit 
 Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit 
 D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all 
 These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on 
 Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off 
 First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go 
  
  
 And I'd take probation 
 I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation 
 Private plane, pick location 
 I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation 
 Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard 
 And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it 
 But in the meantime you can call me young Roy 
 Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge 
 Shit, don't leave me unguarded 
 And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi 
 Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed 
 All that blood like the Red Sea parted 
 My gun go crazy like it's retarded 
 Red light on it like it's recording 
 I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in' 
 My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't 
 Better dig in your pocket and pay homage 
 Better cover your eyes, your face fallin' 
 Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin' 
 No, I didn't say that I'm flawless 
 But I damn sure don't tarnish 
 My pistol got comments for your garments 
 I'm so high I can vomit on a comet 
 K-Y, no homo, I'm on it 
 Weezy F Baby, new born bitch 
 You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch 
 I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get 
 Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit 
 And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit 
 That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit 
 That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit 
 And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit 
 I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!"" 
 Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me! 
 You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat 
 Fireman burn down your entire street 
 So fly I'ma take off when I leap 
 Bye! And you can suck my wings 
 Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming 
 Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things 
 I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens 
 But I ain't the dealer 
 House full of bitches like Tila Tequila 
 Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror 
 My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her? 
 Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?

 And basically, to see a change in me 
 I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah 
 Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind 
 Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

 A little bit in love with you 
 I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit 
 A little bit in love with you 
  
  
 I know you told me break their hearts 
 But it's you I wanna take apart 
 And I will never ever be the first, to say it 
 But still I, they know I 
 I would do it, push a button 
 Pull a trigger, climb a mountain 
 Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby 
 I love you, love you, a little bit 
 I would do it, you would say it 
 You would mean it, we could do it 
 It was you and I and only I, mmm

 A little bit in love with you 
 But only if you're a little bit

 I hope they never find out 
 What they already know, know, know 
 As soon as it's official 
 We'll have to let it go, go, go 
 So we don't confirm the fling 
 Keep avoiding all the questions 
 You could teach me many things 
 I'm just scared to learn a lesson 
 The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome 
 Both in sync like a Justin song 
 Feels so right but it's just, so wrong 
 I wonder where my world 'bout 
 When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out 
 And her friends say I ain't the one to go for 
 She just jealous cause you always get approached more 
 Oh well, tell her fall back 
 Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back 
 Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass 
 Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that

 I be over there, shawty, I be over there 
 I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there 
 And you don't even have to ask twice 
 You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice 
 Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life 
 Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life 
 Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on 
 That's when you're the prettiest 
 I hope that you don't take it wrong 
 You don't even trip when friends say 
 ""You ain't bringin' Drake along?"" 
 You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

 Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc 
 When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture 
 And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister 
 Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue 
 They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
 She call me the referee 'cause I be so official 
 My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle 
 Like the Andy Griffith theme song 
 And who told you to put them jeans on? 
 Double cup love, you the one I lean on 
 Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on 
 Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

 But I work hard, so I deserve it 
 And I belong, right where you see me 
 Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny 
 Nah, I got a decent set of manners 
 And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner 
 And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour 
 Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana 
 So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it 
 But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it 
 You could show up at the party on dirty public transit 
 And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids 
 Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed 
 With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed 
 I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin' 
 But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

 And I work harder than hard workin' 
 Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface 
 Therefore I act a clown 
 Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down 
 So over-stand me 
 I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy 
 And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy 
 And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana 
 And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin' 
 And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick 
 Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop"" 
 She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop 
 And she say I freak that pussy better 
 Better than her gynecologist, ho just 
 Text me whenever you want some more dick 
 More dick, old bitch, young bitch 
 But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

 Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace

 Uh-huh 
  
  
 Uh, hardly home but always reppin' 
 You hardly on and always second 
 When I'm awake, you always restin' 
 And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned 
 I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions 
 Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin' 
 That's why I never follow y'all suggestions 
 I just always did my own thing 
 Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas 
 I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes 
 Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better 
 'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her 
  
  
 It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay 
 It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends

 Yeah, wrong way down a one-way 
 Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday 
 Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who 
 Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you"" 
 And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house 
 Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth 
 Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her 
 I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther 
 I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady 
 They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady 
 Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy 
 Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady 
 Damn, whose line is it anyways? 
 I'm in a daze, you been amazed 
 Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage 
 I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze 
 I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice 
 And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright 
 Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will 
 I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real 
 Put it to your life

 Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest 
 Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused 
 The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's 
 Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust 
 Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on 
 I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb 
 I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight 
 From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike 
 Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night 
 Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white 
 Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right 
 Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night 
 This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long 
 The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song 
 UGK and Young Money, too strong 
 Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

 'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy 
 Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy 
 Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch 
 And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch 
 I'm so uptown 
 And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah 
 And now I'm on that rock shit 
 But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit

 I forgot to call you on your birthday 
 You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah 
 There is nothing I can do to fix it 
 All you ever asked me for was time, whoa 
  
  
 When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to 
 And I finally get a moment to myself 
 I will realize you were everything I'm missing 
 And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else 
  
  
 So can you do me a favor? 
 If I pull it together, make it sooner than later 
 We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long 
 But please don't move on

 I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose? 
 What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time? 
 And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind? 
 Night's fallin', lights glowing 
 And I'm just trying to pay the price owing 
 And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing 
 And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments 
 Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision 
 'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision

 I'm just so far gone 
 October's own 
 Please leave me alone 
 Drunk off champagne 
 Screamin' in the phone 
 See my house is not a home 
 Fuck is going on? 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Where do we belong? 
 Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone 
 Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on 
 When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone 
 Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne 
 And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't 
 Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known 
 To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone 
 Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown 
 I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown 
 It's only been three years 
 Look at how I've grown 
 I'm just in my zone 
 I call this shit the calm 
 Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm 
 Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond 
 Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long 
 You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm 
 Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known 
 I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne 
 I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause 
  
  
 You know everything gon' be all right, I promise 
 I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but 
 40 Mama always say don’t ask permission 
 Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah 
 Say 
  
  
 Uh 
 And life is so insane 
 Look what I became trying to make a name 
 All my first dates are interrupted by my fame 
 Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain 
 They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain 
 It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain 
 Women need attention, therefore, women will complain 
 Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame 
 Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game 
 I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne 
 It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing 
 So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain 
 Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange 
 'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed 
 Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range 
 And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change 
 Damn, and I can only feel his pain 
 'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain 
 So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again 
 He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain 
 I'm why your girl heart is in a sling 
 Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame 
 As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king 
 With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain 
 Yeah, and see, this is the thang 
 What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain 
 The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane 
 Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah 
  
  
 Uh 
 I said I call this shit the calm 
 But I’m the furthest thing from calm

 That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside

 Is this gonna last?

 That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside

 At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in 
 Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman 
 We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than 
 Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than 
 A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in 
 Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things 
 I float high, don't try and cut my water wings 
 I'm still myself 
 Suicide bars, I kill myself 
 Charge it to the game, I bill myself 
 And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself 
 Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov 
 I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off 
 I'm next to blow, pause 
 And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers} 
 Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know 
 Send the haters all my love, X and O 
 I got a black box where suggestions go 
 But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know 
 My reality is brighter than your dreams are 
 I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car 
 Yeah, and the visual is stunnin' 
 I hope they document what I'm becomin' 
 Congratulations 
  
  
 So what you want an award or somethin'? 
 I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin' 
 I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing 
 Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin' 
 But I ain't with the hard talk 
 I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk 
 Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark 
 Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start 
 I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin' 
 My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin' 
 And my verses gettin' stupider 
 Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter? 
 Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular 
 I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula 
 I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula 
 When I break it down, when I, when I break it down 
 I hug and kiss the drum kick 
 I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit 
 But, you could never beat my ass, pause 
 Again, dammit y'all, again 
 Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in 
 I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win 
 If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him 
 And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them 
 Right, uh 
  
  
 It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy 
 Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy 
 They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege 
 But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say 
 I got the key to happiness and all the copies 
 Remember this day like you bought a poppy 
 And damn, how I get so nice? 
 I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice 
 Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin' 
 I always choose dough like it's my only option 
 'Cause money always knows best 
 Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest"" 
 And I'm what all the fuss about 
 And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout 
 Hit me at the office, same extension

 Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along 
 I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone 
 And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on 
 I can't even capture the feeling I had at first 
 Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works 
 The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse 
 Their actions out of character even when they rehearse 
 Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave 
 I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place 
 Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved 
 And they don't like that, it's written all on they face 
 I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean 
 Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team 
 Iconic duos rip and split at the seams 
 Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes 
 Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe 
 Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace 
 Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet 
 Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

 Missin' out on my years 
 There's times when I wish I was where I was 
 Back when I used to wish I was here 
 Missin' out on my days 
 Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise 
 Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways 
 I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade 
 Most times it's just somebody that's underaged 
 That's probably just alone and afraid 
 And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain 
 I always hear people complain about the place that they live 
 That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give 
 'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit 
 That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is 
 I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome 
 Then she finally got to Rome 
 And all she did was post pictures for people at home 
 'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known 
 I know another girl that's cryin' out for help 
 But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone"" 
 I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone 
 I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown 
 To post later and make it look like she still on the go 
 Look at the way we live 
 I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world 
 I was hidin' the world from my kid 
 From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate 
 Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate 
 Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs 
 The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call 
 They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?"" 
 You know a wise man once said nothin' at all 
 I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend 
 All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch 
 All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end? 
 I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

 Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah) 
 Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax 
 My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts 
 This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats 
 Based off of that, they gotta run me the max 
 They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks 
 They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps

 Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon 
 Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest 
 Only problems I do are math problems with profit 
 Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics 
 Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it 
 Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses 
 Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?"" 
 Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes 
 When life comin' at you from all angles and sides 
 And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside 
 It really boils down to how you plan to survive 
 Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em 
 Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em? 
 Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom 
 And they recognize the bathroom 
 All hell starts to break loose in my texts 
 I only tell lies to who I gotta protect 
 I would rather have you remember me how we met 
 I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect 
 But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step 
 That ain't what I'm 'bout 
 I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt 
 If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without 
 They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without 
 Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house 
 My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South 
 Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts? 
 Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out? 
 Is there more? Yeah 
  
  
 Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice 
 The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth 
 Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot 
 Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs 
 I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who? 
 I'll let you bring a thousand recruits 
 My peers are a talented group 
 But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two 
 Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops 
 There's still nothin' they could really do 
 It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due 
 Whenever it's time to recoup 
 Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal 
 In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?"" 
 I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die 
 What you got, time on your hands or time on your side? 
 Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? 
 Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? 
 Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies 
 Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties 
 And all of these fortunate times 
 And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? 
 Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? 
 Like healin' my soul, like family time 
 Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? 
 Is there more?

 How you even managin' to keep straight faces 
 In all the pictures that I seen lately 
 Lord knows you still look amazin' 
 That's besides the point I'm makin' 
 You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it 
 You had potential, I coulda shaped it 
 You went and caved in (Ooh yeah) 
 We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages 
 You're old enough, but you're still a baby 
 You've shared stories where you did amazin' 
 Things to be loyal, things to be patient 
 That was before me, I musta changed it 
 Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

 They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options 
 'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin' 
 And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin' 
 And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it 
 And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it 
 I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

 Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark) 
 You can't get enough 
 Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark 
  
  
 Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin' 
 Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend 
 Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall 
 I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls 
 'Cause you've been so patient 
 I drink on the job and smoke on the job 
 So, I don't know how serious you take it 
 Can't offer much more, you've heard it before 
 That narrative for me isn't changin' 
 I wanna make you a priority 
 I wanna let you know there's more to me 
 I wanna have your faith restored in me

 Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool 
 Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah 
 Get the vibe right, get your mind right 
 It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah) 
 Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet 
 We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet 
 You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else 
 You like, ""Fuck these niggas,"" rather keep it to yourself 
 He did you wrong, he left you down bad 
 Now you can't trust nobody 
 You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me"" 
 I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me 
 Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost 
 And when it's after dark anything goes

 Yesterday morning was crazy 
 I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe 
 That shit is in stone, sealed and signed 
 She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine 
 Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time 
 And all it took was one time 
 Shit, we only met two times, two times 
 And both times were nothin' like the new times 
 Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines 
 Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes 
 It's breakin' my spirit 
 Single father, I hate when I hear it 
 I used to challenge my parents on every album 
 Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent 
 Always promised the family unit 
 I wanted it to be different because I've been through it 
 But this is the harsh truth now 
 And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now 
 I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at 
 Or who loves you more or who's not there 
 Who did what to who 'fore you got here 
 Nah, look, I'm too proud 
 To let that come between me and you now 
 Realize I gotta think for two now 
 I gotta make it, I better make it 
 I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated 
 This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated 
 I can't forget the looks on they faces 
 Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin' 
 Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out 
 For our cheers to the next generation 
 But this Champagne toast is short-lived 
 I got an empty crib in my empty crib 
 I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick 
 I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts 
 Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit 
 But man, you know 
 I still had to get it for my boy though, you know 
 You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip 
 He probably coulda did stand-up 
 Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up 
 And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up 
 October baby for irony's sake, of course 
 I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours 
 And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more 
 Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground 
 They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town 
 Hopefully by the time you hear this 
 Me and your mother will have come around 
 Instead of always cuttin' each other down 
 God willin', I got a good feelin' 
 You got a good spirit 
 We'll talk more when you hear this my G 
  
  
 I'm changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain

 So watch how you speak on my name, you know? 
  
  
 Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid 
 You couldn't buy the real thing 
 I was stayin’ up at yo' place 
 Tryin' to figure out the whole thing 
 I saw people doin' things 
 Almost gave up on the music thing

 Hidden Hills where I post 
 I start my day slow 
 Silk pajamas when I wake though 
 Miraval to the face though 
 I drunk text J-Lo 
 Old number, so it bounce back 
 Boi-1da got the bounce back 
 Used to get paid for shows in front-door money 
 Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that 
 Me and Gibbo was about that 
 Eatin' Applebee's and Outback 
 Southwest, no first class 
 Hilton rooms, gotta double up 
 Writin’ our name on a double cup 
 We ain’t even have a tour bus 
 Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me 
 I fall asleep in sororities 
 I had some different priorities 
 Weezy had all the authority 
 Women I like was ignorin' me 
 Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?"" 
 I know the question rhetorical 
 I took the team plane from Oracle 
 Mama never used to cook much 
 Used to chef KD 
 Now me and Chef, KD 
 Bet on shots for twenty G's

 So let's just get it out the way 
 Lot of niggas goin' bad on me 
 Please, one at a time 
 I wanna move to Dubai 
 So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys 
 I didn't listen to Hov on that old song 
 When he told me pay it no mind

 Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months 
 Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21 
 They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones 
 I got Dubai plates in the California state 
 I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way 
 I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face 
 Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight 
 Couple niggas from the city 
 Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake 
 Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way 
 Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate 
 My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take 
 40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake 
 She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date 
 Niggas see me in person 
 First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break."" 
 Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait? 
 Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate 
 So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say 
 Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced 
 It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah 
  
  
 And I'm convinced 
 I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since

 Used to trap out the Hilton 
 Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters 
 Count a bankroll for dinner 
 This the wrong place to enter 
 Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us 
 Met her at the Super Bowl 
 Told her I stayed down the street from Texas 
 A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist 
 This one here out the fence 
 Trap jumpin' like the Carter, mean it jumpin' like Vince 
 Moved on from the election 
 Introduced her to the plug 
 Can't believe they tried to take the connection 
 Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'

 No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina 
 Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season 
 Queen Street visions that nobody believed in 
 If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin' 
 Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd 
 The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin' 
 Not when everybody out here beefin' 
 We got it, now we just gotta keep it 
 America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run 
 All these number ones and we still not the ones 
 No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun 
 Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb 
 Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin' 
 My competition, it's beyond offensive 
 I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention 
 Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance 
 Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission 
 This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches? 
 Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it 
 Too late for condolences when it's over with 
 I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it 
 Be open with people I need some closure with 
 Be honest with myself and take ownership 
 Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn 
 I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first 
 Excitin' times, revitalized 
 Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively 
 I'm just takin' what God will give me 
 Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey 
 Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me 
 I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky 
 I wrote the book on world-class finesses 
 And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts 
 And never placin' second 
 And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second 
 Inspirin' and never takin' credit 
 I know I deserve more, I just never said it 
 Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah 
  
  
 Did I lose you?

 Did I lose you? 
 Did I? Did I?

 Winnin' is problematic 
 People like you more when you workin' towards somethin' 
 Not when you have it 
 Way less support from my peers 
 In recent years as I get established 
 Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage 
 Why is my struggle different than others'? 
 Only child that’s takin' care of his mother 
 As health worsens and bills double 
 That’s not respectable all of a sudden? 
 I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up? 
 What do you see when you see me? 
 When did all the things I mean 
 From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning? 
 Maybe I share it with too many people 
 Back then it used to just feel like our secret 
 Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it 
 I be tryna manifest the things I needed 
 And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me 
 But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all 
 How they go from not wantin' me at all 
 To wantin' to see me lose it all? 
 Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin' 
 I'm overcome with emotions 
 Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober 
 Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra 
 I could only speak what I know of 
 Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin' 
 And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin' 
 And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin' 
 All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies 
 Ego strokin', picture postin' 
 Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only 
 But you just had to show me 
 See, I know, 'cause I study you closely 
 I know when someone lyin' 
 I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired 
 I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet 
 Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you 
  
  
 Did I? Did I? 
 Did I lose you? 
 Did I? Did I? 
 Did I lose you?

 Hand on my heart 
 And I, I wish time never mattered 
  
  
 Yeah, stylin’ though 
 Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though 
 All the things you need, you still want problems though 
 All the things I know, I still been silent though 
 Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo 
 Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes 
 I don't want to have to go to funerals 
 I gotta start sleepin' at the studio 
 I don't have no time to be no Romeo 
 All the love I need is at the rodeo 
 All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah 
 All the girls I know are there with E and Tho 
 Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old? 
 Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes 
 Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone 
 I take a glass of Domina to go with me home 
 Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome 
 I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on 
 Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves 
 I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views 
 Saw a side of myself that I just never knew 
 I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do 
 Steady doin' double shifts 
 1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click 
 More blessings because I'm generous 
 Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us 
 Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet 
 She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it 
 Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it 
 Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it 
 Scary whenever I close my eyes at night 
 Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life 
 I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights 
 But you can rest assured that my mind is right 
 Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days 
 Never stick around to see shit change 
 Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' 
 Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin' 
 Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV 
 To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' 
 I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this 
 Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense 
 Especially people that want to lecture me 
 And frame it like they just want the best for me 
 Or they check for me, whatever splits it up 
 So there's more for them and there's less for me 
 They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me 
 No one's done it successfully 
 7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me 
 Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery 
 Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me 
 That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency 
 Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally 
 Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly 
 If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me 
 You overnight celebrity, you one day star 
 Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity 
 I am a reflection of all of your insecurities 
 Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping 
 Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me 
 There's real ones around me 
 I want to make sure they learn from me 
 I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety 
 He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency 
 My life is centered 'round competition and currency 
 Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery 
 Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me 
 I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

 Much closer 
 All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore 
 Guess that's what they say you need family for 
 Cause I can't depend on you anymore 
  
  
 Always saw you for what you could've been 
 Ever since you met me 
 Like when Chrysler made that one car 
 That looked just like the Bentley 
 I always saw you for what you could've been 
 And even when it's business with you it's personal again 
 I knew you before you made ends meet 
 And now we're meeting our end 
  
  
 And it's all because you chose a side 
 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You're so predictable I hate people like you 
 Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you 
 How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through 
 You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
 You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures 
 I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas 
 With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong 
 Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on 
 I don't know what's going on 
  
  
 And it's all because you chose a side 
 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align 
 My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right 
 When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice 
 But you always had something to say every other time 
 Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way 
 I'm fooding and serving them all 
 Like I'm working for minimum wage 
 Someone up there must just love testing my patience 
 Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment 
 Forgiveness for your ways 
 If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised 
 Same way I'm right here still feeling the way 
 Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

 Better than her telling me the check's no good

 Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it 
 Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it 
 You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it 
 And I can't sleep these days unless I take one 
 If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one

 Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it 
 They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it

 Don't you see Riri right next to me?

 They feel the same, but they hide it 
 They just discuss it in private

 I hate a goofy especially 
 They always dyin' to mention me 
 They gotta die out eventually 
 I cannot give you the recipe 
 You know the game is sold separately 
 Swear I just had an epiphany 
 It cost me 50 at Tiffany's

 The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious 
 I feed my family with this 
 So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious 
 I don't run out of material 
 You shouldn't speak on me, period 
 You try to give 'em your side of the story

 Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny 
 Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies 
 Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries 
 Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it 
 He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement 
 He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment 
 Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission 
 We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him 
 Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know 
 Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show 
 I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?"" 
 I mean, you boys not even coming close 
 I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration 
 You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places 
 Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear 
 Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care 
 No tender love and care, no love and affection 
 I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting 
 I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson 
 Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together 
 Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester 
 40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure 
 A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin' 
 A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation 
 Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day 
 You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday 
 You don't be scorin' perfect 
 You don't be workin' like how we be workin' 
 You platinum like wrappers 
 On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless 
 You get the message over and over like it was urgent 
 And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person 
 The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in 
 And did it with a purpose 
 Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships 
 Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension 
 A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned 
 Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention 
 It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder 
 The most successful rapper 35 and under 
 I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under 
 That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded 
 Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin 
 She violated, I sent her back where it all started 
 How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment 
 Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness 
 Told my momma that I found a lady in the east 
 Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite 
 Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free 
 I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me 
 You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique 
 Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats 
 I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat 
 Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE 
 The best ever, don't ever question, you know better 
 But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together 
 Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it 
 Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled 
 Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal 
 Don't let your newfound fame fool you 
 Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this 
 Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter 
 Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit 
 Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it 
 Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it 
 Too busy face screwin' on waste movements 
 You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin' 
 First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it 
 And they still take to it 
 Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid 
 And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it 
 But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful 
 But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want 
 Get high when I want

 Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?

 Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women 
 I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it 
 Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision 
 Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment 
 Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me 
 That mean a lot to me 
 Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me 
 This year for Christmas I just want apologies 
 Sydney gave up on me when I went missin' 
 Syn had a baby and treated me different 
 Erika sued me and opened a business 
 Wonder if they wish it could've been different 
 Wonder what they'd do put in my position 
 I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen? 
 Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions 
 I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven 
 Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough 
 Until enough is enough, and then it's too much 
 You tip the scale when I weigh my options 
 West Palm girls are spoiled rotten 
 Tiffany on you, you know you poppin' 
 I'll kill somebody if they give you problems 
 Master bedroom's where we get it poppin' 
 Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet 
 I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit 
 Sell my secrets and get top dollar 
 Sell my secrets for a Range Rover 
 Opportunity and temptation 
 They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation 
 Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin' 
 Who's gonna save me when I need savin'? 
 Since Take Care, I've been caretakin' 
 But second chances, that ain't how you livin'

 No, no-no-no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no 
  
  
 Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure 
 And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham 
 A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section 
 OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up 
 And I know who gon' take the fall with me 
 They right here on call with me, they all with me 
 You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted 
 They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it? 
 Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me 
 I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me 
 Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday 
 Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray 
 I dropped out right before I graduate 
 Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day 
 “It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait” 
 And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say 
 Lately I just feel so out of character 
 The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance 
 Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist 
 I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison 
 I'm gettin' straight to the point with it 
 Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas 
 Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition 
 It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business 
 But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute 
  
  
 Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals 
 My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below 
 Who you think runnin' this show? 
 You saw it in me at 20 years old 
 The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code 
 I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate 
 You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made 
 Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change 
 Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game 
 Still drop 40 with liquor in my system 
 Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance 
 I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya 
 Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian 
 Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale 
 And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales 
 Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL 
 I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself 
 Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts 
 I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts 
 They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon 
 I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room 
 Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus 
 And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us 
 Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever 
 I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together 
 And my life is on display like Truman 
 They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner 
 My exes made some of my favorite music 
 I dated women from my favorite movies 
 Karma's such a thing of beauty 
 I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it 
 It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters 
 I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever 
 I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you 
 If I was you, I wouldn't like me either 
 Yeah","question is, will i ever leave you? the answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no no, no-no-no, no, no no, no, no, no question is, will i ever leave you? the answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no no, no-no-no, no, no no, no, no, no  yeah, you feel the pressure, man, i know the pressure and my wifey is a spice like i'm david beckham a lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section ovo on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up and i know who gon' take the fall with me they right here on call with me, they all with me you could throw curve balls but i got the glove fitted they've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it? toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me i worked at jaydees connections whenever jason let me ceesay’s, i was buyin' fitteds everyday kiddie's caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray i dropped out right before i graduate six credits left, my mama had her saddest day “it's only up from here, i promise, you just gotta wait” and she took my word for it, that's all i had to say lately i just feel so out of character the paranoia can start to turn into arrogance thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist i get a blank page when i try to draw a comparison i'm gettin' straight to the point with it need y'all to know that i never needed none of y'all niggas fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition it's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business but i haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute  look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals my niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below who you think runnin' this show? you saw it in me at 20 years old the lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code i got a pure soul, i don't do the hate you don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made me and niko used to plot on how to make a change now me and kobe doin' shots the night before the game still drop 40 with liquor in my system numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance i might see you on and off but i'll never switch ya niggas quick to double cross like both of us christian lamborghini got me feelin' like i'm christian bale and i never bend my morals for the ticket sales tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple xl i never tag no one in, i'd rather get you myself runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts i'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts they think i had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon i still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus and like it's goin' in a trunk, i put it all behind us where you tryna go? i got it, i'll take us wherever i'm a staple in the game, all my papers together and my life is on display like truman they wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner my exes made some of my favorite music i dated women from my favorite movies karma's such a thing of beauty i'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it it's farfetched like i threw that shit a hundred meters i keep it a hundred like i'm running a fever i might take a breather but i won't ever leave you if i was you, i wouldn't like me either yeah",-0.9,2.0,0.7628634435294097,0.18274757959407356,0.6367189121443033,0.5941961444377178,0.43209030674529736,0.34718926025887137,0.2717023446988991,0.25029850934601805,0.16060149368169946,0.4546684623164282,311.96

 But, I'm not really sure what else you expected 
 When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective 
 With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message 
 40, did you get the message? 
 'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it 
 I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort 
 But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together 
 Yeah, not here to fight wars 
 But niggas wanna talk high scores 
 PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche 
 And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for 
 But, I got bigger fish to fry 
 I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I 
 Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine 
 And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified 
 Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night 
 Flyin' over Chattanooga 
 Out here tryna spread the movement 
 I just got me the Mercedes Pullman 
 You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google 
 Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal 
 These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies 
 They've been droppin' out on both sides 
 We ain't in it, we just ghost ride 
 The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines 
 I thought you wanted yours like I want mine 
 I guess you just makin' moves on your own time 
 But just know it'll be January in no time 
 And your absence is very concernin' 
 It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin' 
 Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30 
 Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey 
 I got a club in the Raptors arena 
 Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons 
 Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with 
 I'm legally obligated if they request it 
 So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson 
 Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction 
 Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting 
 Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum 
 I just listened to Closer to My Dreams 
 Wide eyed and uneducated at 19 
 I can't rap like that, all young and naive 
 Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe 
 Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience 
 I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it 
 4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious 
 You loved me back in the basement 
 Guess it is what we make it 
 I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways 
 Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away 
 Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother 
 The season start and I don't wanna 
 See you end up with nothin' 
 Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion 
 Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin' 
 They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden 
 Now you the one gettin' buckets 
 They put their arm around you 
 Now you becomin' the crutches 
 Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to 
 And women that you seen on TV look better in person 
 And either they wanna fuck you or convince you 
 That they care to see where it goes from there 
 But these ain't the girls from Brampton 
 This ain't that local action 
 The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually 
 What happened to the things 
 You niggas said was supposed to happen? 
 Are we just supposed to 
 Ignore the fact that it never happened? 
 We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two? 
 Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you? 
 My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf 
 And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves 
 Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios 
 6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit 
 When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I 
 And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""

 It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?) 
 New friends all in their old feelings now

 Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo! 
 Dance how I dance, watch me dance 
 You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced 
 After this drop I got new demands 
 Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then 
 Make sure the plane got a phone now

 About all of the money that done came and went 
 About the two cents I ain't never spent 
 When they say you're too famous to pack a gat 
 I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from 
 Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone 
 Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone 
 Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone 
 Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones 
 Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns 
 Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron 
 Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6 
 Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry 
 You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry 
 I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87 
 Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em 
 I ain't got no time 
 Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence

 Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it 
 I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it 
 I told 1da send me something and I got it covered 
 Somehow I always rise above it 
 Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? 
 The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive 
 Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor 
 Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested 
 Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question 
 Last night I went to sleep wanting more 
 Tryna decide what direction I should go towards 
 Some nights I wish I could go back in life 
 Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 
 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me 
 Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me 
 Prolly forever if I stay in my zone 
 I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone 
 I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe 
 That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside 
 Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage 
 You need to act your age and not your girl's age 
 It gets worse by the annual 
 My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man 
 Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah 
 I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em 
 To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention 
 I remember when it used to be music that did it 
 But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? 
 I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with 
 I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with 
 If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin' 
 We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on 
 But here we are, yeah 
 Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence 
 They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments 
 Bitches alter my messages like we had words 
 And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve 
 Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing 
 Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image 
 I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year 
 Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year 
 And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 
 'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block 
 Nobody lookin' out for nobody 
 Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody 
 Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it 
 And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it 
 And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it 
 Damn, I just had to say my piece about it 
 Oh, you gotta love it— 
 But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject 
 I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget 
 I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins 
 Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca 
 Julia, Ericka, Southern America 
 Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance 
 Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow 
 Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent 
 I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' 
 But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement 
 Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? 
 Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too 
 I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas 
 Bein' number two is just being the first to lose 
 My city dictated music, nobody seein' us 
 Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up 
 Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough 
 Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup 
 Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all 
 You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all 
 ""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago 
 Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go 
 Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? 
 Why you rappin' like you come from the streets? 
 I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees 
 And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves 
 Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease 
 I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese 
 Special order for anybody that's comin' for me 
 Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze 
 You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me 
 Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free 
 I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat 
 Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats 
 Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah 
 And on top of that it's getting harder to eat 
 Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease 
 To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me 
 And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe 
 But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh) 
 Yeah 
 And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop) 
 I know your girl well, just not in public 
 Blame the city, I'm a product of it 
 Young nigga from the city 
 You gotta love it 
  
  
 Yeah, gotta love it 
 *Laughs* 
 Yeah","yeah yeah  oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it i heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it i told 1da send me something and i got it covered somehow i always rise above it why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? the game is all mine and i'm mighty possessive lil wayne could not have found him a better successor every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested allen iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question last night i went to sleep wanting more tryna decide what direction i should go towards some nights i wish i could go back in life not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me prolly forever if i stay in my zone i speak on this generation, but can't change it alone i heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in vibe that's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside oh, you tried? it's so childish calling my name on the world stage you need to act your age and not your girl's age it gets worse by the annual my career's like a how-to manual, so i guess it's understandable, man oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em to show they outfits off, guess they need the attention i remember when it used to be music that did it but then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? i'm managed by my friends that i grew up with i'd rather give that 15% to people i fuck with if me and future hadn't made it with this rappin' we'd prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on but here we are, yeah lately, i feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments bitches alter my messages like we had words and stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve bitter women i'm overtextin' are pmsing crazy this year—fuckin' with my image i've been tryna reach the youth so i can save 'em this year fuck it, i guess i gotta wait 'til next year and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 'bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block nobody lookin' out for nobody maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can tweet about it and then they start to ""r.i.p."" about it and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it damn, i just had to say my piece about it oh, you gotta love it— but they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject i been whippin' mercedes and nigga try to budget i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins shout out to ashley, tasha, bianca julia, ericka, southern america part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow comeback flow, once i start it's apparent i'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' but fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too i wanna prove that i'm number one over all these niggas bein' number two is just being the first to lose my city dictated music, nobody seein' us winter here already, but somehow i'm heatin' up been observin' the game and felt like i've seen enough let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all you rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all ""best i ever had"" seems like a decade ago decadent flow and i still got a decade to go oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? why you rappin' like you come from the streets? i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees and i'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese special order for anybody that's comin' for me shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze you see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, oli, and me cuttin' all loose ends, i be the barber for free i'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat feel like i'm in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah and on top of that it's getting harder to eat rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease to think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me and now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe but, man, oh, you gotta love it (oh) yeah and head to toe, i'm prada covered (whoop) i know your girl well, just not in public blame the city, i'm a product of it young nigga from the city you gotta love it  yeah, gotta love it *laughs* yeah",-0.3,3.4,0.9640634078842286,0.5711322131108659,0.8236196721581857,0.5828401676569791,0.8842055085620006,0.583443062538141,0.13630709572315242,0.32693548830322655,0.18962553406362231,0.2467891854280842,283.306

 Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record 
 Just to off these records, nigga that's a record 
 I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure 
 Past the present when you have to mention 
 This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though 
 Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go 
 Heavy airplay all day with no chorus 
 We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas 
 I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga 
 I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga 
 Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga 
 I could go a hour on this beat, nigga 
 I'm just as famous as my mentor 
 But that's still the boss, don't get sent for 
 Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for 
 Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more 
 Hot temper, scary outcome 
 Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one 
 That always let they mouth run 
 Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it 
 Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it 
 Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick 
 Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit 
 Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich 
 Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup 
  
  
 Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV 
 Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me 
 Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me 
 I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family 
 Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' 
 I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it 
 I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it 
 Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin' 
 On a mission tryna shift the culture 
 Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit 
 Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin' 
 All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments 
 Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message 
 Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive 
 That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure 
 Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort 
 I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless 
 Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace 
 My life's a completed checklist 
 I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now 
 Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now 
 That's real 
  
  
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento 
 I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo 
 The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk 
 Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow 
 This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo 
 I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em) 
 The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie 
 All these 90's fantasies on my mind 
 The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time 
 I might come through without security to check if you're fine 
 That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO 
 Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself"" 
 You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself 
 And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help 
 You know, back on your feet and shit 
 Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? 
 Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese 
 And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
  
  
 If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life.

 Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like? 
  
  
 Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back 
 Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map 
 I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first 
 It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach"" 
 Open cases on me for a half a million each 
 I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know 
 Luckily I didn't have to grow there 
 I would only go there cause niggas that I know there 
 I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush 
 When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize 
 He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy 
 You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be 
 People like Mazin who was a best friend to me 
 Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life 
 And this life started lacking synergy 
 And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be 
 Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys

 You've been caught up 
 With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love 
 You shouldn't have to deal with that 
 I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause... 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us 
 So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? 
 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love 
  
  
 Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive 
 Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance 
 I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping 
 I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different 
 Started realizing a couple places I could take it 
 I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement 
 I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation 
 And influence a generation that's lacking in patience 
 I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience 
 Just me and my old man getting back to basics 
 We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted 
 When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing 
 Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas 
 We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us 
 We even talked about you and our couple of moments 
 He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups 
 You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone 
 Looking like you came from the 70's on your own 
 My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is 
 Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? 
 You don't even know what you want from love anymore 
 I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? 
 Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us 
 So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? 
 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love 
  
  
 Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures 
 Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage 
 When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit 
 A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 
 'Cause that night I played her three songs 
 Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on 
 Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz 
 Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off 
 Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria 
 Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria 
 Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music 
 When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it 
 The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree 
 I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me 
 Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? 
 Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't 
 Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz 
 Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision 
 Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions 
 When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven 
 It seem like you don't want this love anymore 
 I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? 
 Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us 
 That's why you trust me 
 I know you been through more than most of us 
 So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? 
 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

 Isn't it amazing? 
 How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication 
 How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing 
 How every conversation starts with ""this time will be different"" 
 Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun 
 Oh, the idea is so fun every time 
 At least we try for home run every time 
  
  
 Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging 
 Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me 
 Same city, same friends, if you're looking 
 I'll be here just swanging 
 Don't talk to me like I'm famous 
 And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe 
 I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby 
 Yeah, swanging 
  
  
 She just wanna run around the city and make memories 
 That she can barely remember 
 And I'd allow her 
 Talk about pussy power 
 She just wanna run over my feelings 
 Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler 
 And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power 
 She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself"" 
 Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was 
 And never leave as myself 
 But when it falls apart, I'm always still down 
 To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground 
 Wish you would learn to love people and use things 
 And not the other way around

 I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is 
 She call and tell me be here before the sun up 
 I be dressed before we hung up 
 I take Eglinton to 401 east 
 And exit at Markham road in the east end 
 Where all the pretty girls are sleeping 
 My license been expired I renew it after the weekend 
 Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends 
 Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness 
 I hate stoppin' for gas this late 
 Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin' 
 Summer is comin' know you could feel it 
 20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it 
 Won't knock on your door 
 My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours"" 
 I got the pedal to the floor 
 I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin' 
 Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there 
 I'll be there just swangin'

 I am the one you should worry 'bout 
 I don't know who you're referring to 
 Who is this nigga you heard about? 
 Someone just talking that bullshit 
 Man, someone just gave you the run-around 
 Niggas downplayin' the money 
 But that's what you do when the money down 
 I don't waste time puttin' money down 
 I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash 
 Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour 
 And you gotta fly in first class 
 This has been years in the makin' 
 It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer 
 Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'

 Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell 
 I will never understand that, but oh well

 I'd much rather sit here in silence 
 I send all my money to banks in the islands 
 And eat with Italians, I do 
 People are funny, you don't even know 
 'Bout the shit that I been through 
 I just want some head in a comfortable bed 
 It could all be so simple 
 Talkin' that shit with your back to me 
 Just know it always get back to me 
 Come get your girl, she been here for three days 
 And she way too attached to me 
 Hate when they get too attached to me 
 I got to get on the bus and get back on the road 
 Get what I can out the country 
 And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold 
 Can't even drive with the top off 
 I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer 
 I just might bring in some girls from Miami 
 To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

 Done sayin' I'm done playin' 
 Last time was on the outro 
 Stuck in the house, need to get out more 
 I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising 
 Most people in my position get complacent 
 Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages 
 I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it 
 Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it 
 I'm the only one that's putting shots up 
 And like a potluck, you need to come with it 
 Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100 
 Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted 
 I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it 
 Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming? 
 Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"" 
 These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there 
 Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out 
 Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now 
 Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out 
 She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

 Money got my whole family going backwards 
 No dinners, no holidays, no nothin' 
 There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'

 My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list 
 And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit 
 Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit 
 Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear 
 Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here 
 Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself 
 That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit 
 And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now 
 Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now 
 Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down 
 I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down 
  
  
 Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much 
 There's no need for us to rush it through 
 Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much 
 This is more than just a new lust for you 
 Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much 
 There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh 
 Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much 
 This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh 
 (Don't do that..) 
  
  
 Don't give up, on your hopes 
 And you tell me somethin's gone wrong 
 Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care

 J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine 
 In the same league, but we don't ball the same 
 (Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time 
 She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line"" 
 Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up 
 Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"" 
 You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo 
 Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note 
 From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off 
 And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off

 Givenchy, nigga, God bless you

 I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6 
 I even fucked the girl that used to babysit 
 But that was years later on some crazy shit 
 I heard your new shit, nigga hated it 
 Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit 
 I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit 
 And my latest shit is like a greatest hits 
 God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side 
 Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all 
 It's no different over on this side 
 God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself? 
 'Cause myself just told myself: 
 ""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"" 
 Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest 
 Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets 
 I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath 
 I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever 
 It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet 
 Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle 
 I was made for all of this shit 
 And I’m on the road box office sales 
 I’m getting paid for all of this shit 
 Ask you to please excuse my table manners 
 I was making room for the table dancers 
 'Cause if we judging off your advances 
 Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

 Ho, shut the fuck up! 
 I got way too much on my mental 
 I learn from what I've been through 
 I'm finna do what I didn't do 
 And still waking up like the rent's due 
 Not complicated, it's simple 
 I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full 
 And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle 
 But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned 
 Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion 
 Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption 
 I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit 
 Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets 
 I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine 
 Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip 
 My new girl is on Glee and shit 
 Probably making more money than me and shit 
 I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
 I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one 
 Like I got trust issues 
 I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out 
 I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom 
 And still gotta pull out 
 But that's just me and I ain't perfect 
 I ain't a saint but I am worth it 
 If it's one thing, I am worth it 
 Niggas still hating but it ain't working 
 Lil' bitch... 
  
  
 Oh me, oh me, oh my 
 I think I done fucked too many women from the 305 
 'Fore the end of this year 
 I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times 
 Smoking on that kush all in our section 
 Like it's legalized 
 Girl, you can't always have your way 
 Sometimes it be like that 
 They don't really fuck with you like that 
 They ain't never did me like that

 What you need right back 
 And I need that shit right back

 Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka 
 Niggas getting nervous 
 Clutching they chests like a muhfucka 
 Damn that’s a motherfucker 
 Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you 
 'Cause I don’t like being lied to 
 And that ship won’t sail 
 And that wind won’t guide you

 On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower 
 So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah) 
 It’s crowded 
 In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it 
 Say you’re down, I could show you around 
 If you’re really about it, yeah 
 But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say? 
 What do you say? 
  
  
 Should we bring it right back? 
 Honestly, it's better like that

 Bring it right back

 Maybe if the mood is right 
 We can bring it right back

 Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded 
 But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it’s cool 
 We can save it for later, yeah 
 I just like the way it feels when you're around 
 When you're around, ah 
 Now I know we're not dating, nah 
 Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages 
 Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love 
 If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out 
 It'll all work out, yeah

 Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright 
 But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

 I'm hoping that you'll say

 To tell you that no one else 
 Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

 but i gave her my time for two or three nights 
 then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again 
 she told me i was never looking for a friend

 baby bring the lemon a bottle of gin 
 well be in between the sheets till the late am 
 baby if you wanted me then you should have just said

 theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes never getting dry so i get high 
 smoke away the days never sleep with the light on 
 weeks pass in the blink of an eye 
 and im still drunk at the end of the night 
 i dont drink like everybody else 
 i do it to forget things about myself 
 stumble and fall with the head spin i got 
 my minds with you but my hearts just not so am i close to you anymore if its over 
 and theres no chance that well work it out thats why you and i ended over uni 
 and i said thats fine 
 but youre the only one that knows i lied 
 you and i ended over uni

 but youre the only one that knows i lied everybody said wed be together forever 
 but i know that i never wanna settle down 
 come around break up the love like lego now 
 never wanna turn into another like you 
 sleep with my thoughts dance with my views everythings great not everythings sure 
 but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus 
 now im in position to be another stalker 
 like everything i say seems to always sound awkward like our last kiss it was perfect 
 but we were nervous on the surface 
 and im always saying everyday that it was worth it 
 pain is only relevent if it still hurts 
 i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative 
 and go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss so am i close to you anymore if its over 
 and theres no chance that well work it out oh you and i ended over uni 
 and i said thats fine 
 but youre the only one that knows i lied 
 you and i ended over uni 
 and i said thats fine 
 but youre the only one that knows i lied because if i was gonna go somewhere 
 id be there by now 
 and maybe i can let myself down 
 and im thinking im unaware 
 i keep my feet on the ground 
 and keep looking around 
 to make sure im not 
 the only one to feel low because if you want 
 ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered 
 from all that ive done wrong 
 and i know youll say 
 that im the only one 
 but i know god made another one of me 
 to love you better than i ever will cause you and i ended over uni

 ive done around about a thousand shows 
 but i havent got a house plus i live on a couch 
 so you believe the lyrics when im singing them out from day one ive been prepared 
 with vo5 wax for my ginger hair 
 so now im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds 
 cause its another day plus ill keep my last name forever keep this genre pretty basic 
 gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when i chase it 
 and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift 
 into another rappers shoes using new laces im selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers

 and that was the first day and darling it was good

 was holy ground spinning like a girl in a brand new dress 
 we had this big wide city all to ourselves 
 we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you 
 and for the first time i had something to lose 
 and i guess we fell apart in the usual way 
 and the storys got dust on every page 
 but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now 
 and i see your face in every crowd cause darling it was good

 we gon put it in reverse darling i told you many times 
 and i am telling you once again 
 just to remind you sweetheart that my oh lamar hail mary and marijuana times is hard 
 pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark 
 fellowship with demons and relatives im a star 
 life is one funny mothafucka 
 a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him 
 i might be buggin infomercials and no sleep 
 introverted by my thoughts 
 children listen it gets deep 
 see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects 
 the object was to process and digest povertys dialect 
 adaptation inevitable gun violence crack spot 
 federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals 
 anthony was the oldest of seven 
 well respected calm and collected 
 laughin and joking made life easier 
 hard times momma on crack 
 a fouryearold telling his nanny he needed her 
 his family history pimpin and bangin 
 he was meant to be dangerous 
 clocked him a grip and start slangin 
 fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces 
 even got some head from a smoker last weekend 
 dodged a policeman workin for his big homie 
 small time hustler graduated to a brick on him 
 ten thousand dollars out of a project housing 
 thats on the daily seen his first mil twenty years old 
 had a couple of babies had a couple of shooters 
 caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun 
 they assumin but witnesses couldnt prove it 
 that was back when he turned his back 
 and they killed his cousin 
 he beat the case and went back to hustlin 
 bird shufflin anthony rang 
 the first in the projects with the twotone mustang 
 that 50 thing they say 50 came 
 circlin parking lots and parking spots 
 and hoppin out while harassing the corner blocks 
 crooked cops told anthony he should kick it 
 he brushed them off and walked back 
 to the kentucky fried chicken 
 see at this chicken spot 
 there was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot 
 with a curly top and a gap in his teeth 
 he worked the window his name was ducky 
 he came from the streets the robert taylor homes 
 southside projects chiraq the terror dome 
 drove to california with a woman on him and 500 dollars 
 they had a son hoping that hed see college 
 hustlin on the side with a nine to five to freak it 
 cadillac seville hed ride his son around on weekends 
 threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket 
 cross the street from the projects 
 anthony planned to rob it 
 stuck up the place before back in 84 
 thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war 
 so many relatives telling us selling us devilish works 
 killing us crime intelligent felonious 
 prevalent proposition with nines 
 ducky was well aware they robbed the manager 
 and shot a customer last year 
 he figured hed get on these niggas good sides 
 free chicken every time anthony posted in line 
 two extra biscuits anthony liked him and then let him slide 
 they didnt kill him in fact it look like 
 theyre the last to survive 
 pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives 
 one curse at a time reverse the manifest 
 and good karma and ill tell you why 
 you take two strangers 
 and put em in random predicaments 
 give em a soul so they can 
 make their own choices and live with it 
 twenty years later them same strangers 
 you make em meet again 
 inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits 
 then you start reminding bout that chicken incident 
 whoever thought the greatest rapper 
 would be from coincidence 
 because if anthony killed ducky 
 top dawg could be servin life

 get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin 
 i practiced runnin from fear guess i had some good luck 
 at 27 years old my biggest fear was bein judged 
 how they look at me reflect on myself my family my city 
 what they say bout me reveal 
 if my reputation would miss me 
 what they see from me 
 would trickle down generations in time 
 what they hear from me 
 would make em highlight my simplest lines 
 im talkin fear fear of losin creativity 
 im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me 
 im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride 
 cause my dna wont let me involve in the light of god 
 im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone 
 im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more 
 im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness 
 fear whatever it is both is distinctive 
 fear what happens on earth stays on earth 
 and i cant take these feelings 
 with me so hopefully they disperse 
 within fourteen tracks carried out over wax 
 searchin for resolutions until somebody get back

 i dont love people enough to put my faith in man 
 i put my faith in these lyrics hoping i make amend 
 i understand i aint perfect 
 i probably wont come around 
 this time i might put you down

 i know the walls they can listen i wish they could talk back 
 the hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that 
 sick venom in men and women overcome with pride 
 a perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies 
 promises are broken and more resentment come alive 
 race barriers make inferior of you and i

 ill choose work over bitches ill make schools out of prison 
 ill take all the religions and put em all in one service

 i met her at this house party on el segundo and central 
 she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta 
 ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel 
 i want to ride like arabians push an 04 mercedesbenz 
 hello my name is kendrick she said no youre handsome 
 whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancing 
 ciara had played in the background 
 the parade music we made had us all wearing shades now cool 
 where you stay she said down the street from dominguez high 
 okay i know thats borderline compton or paramount 
 well is it compton 
 no she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and 
 strictly had wanted her thighs around me 
 seventeen with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental 
 my motive was rather sinful 
 what you trying to get into 
 she didnt tell just gave me her nextel 
 dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well 
 the summer had passed and now im liking her 
 conversation we having probably enticing her 
 who could imagine maybe my actions would end up wifing her 
 love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us 
 its deep rooted the music of being young and dumb 
 is never muted in fact its much louder where im from 
 we know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict 
 she live with her granny and her younger two brothers 
 her favorite cousin demetriuss irrepetible 
 family history of gang banging did make me skeptical 
 but not enough to stop me from getting a nut 
 i wanna come over whats up thats what i told her soon as this episode 
 of martin go off im trying to get off 
 i was in heat like a cactus my tactics of being thirsty 
 probably could hurt me but fuck it i got some heart 
 grab my mommas keys hopped in the car then oh boy 
 so now im down rosecrans in a caravan 
 passing alameda my gas meter in need of a pump 
 i got enough to get me through the traffic jam 
 at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man 
 im thinking bout that sex thinking bout her thighs 
 or maybe kissing on her neck or maybe what positions next 
 sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts 
 i looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette 
 enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse 
 and im a professional porn star when off the goose 
 i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom 
 im hoping to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem 
 im two blocks away 250 feet 
 and six steps from where she stay she waving me cross the street

 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me i woke up this morning and figured id call you 
 in case im not here tomorrow im hoping that i can borrow 
 a peace of mind im behind on whats really important 
 my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life 
 im fortunate you believe in a dream 
 this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine 
 and last night was just another distraction or a reaction 
 of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened 
 you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help 
 held him like a newborn baby and made him feel 
 like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up 
 but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will 
 as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive 
 everybodys a victim in my eyes 
 when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black 
 a demon glued to my back whispering get em 
 i got em and i aint give a fuck 
 that same mentality that told my brother not to duck 
 in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors 
 i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover 
 the life that i knew as a youngn in pajamas and duntaduns 
 when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs 
 dumb niggas like me never prosper 
 prognosis of a problem child im proud and well devoted 
 this piru shit been in me forever 
 so forever imma push it wherever whenever 
 and i love you cause you love my brother like you did 
 just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big 
 and if i die before your album drop i hope gunshots promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 you wrote a song about my sister on your tape 
 and called it section80 the message resembled brendas got a baby 
 whats crazy was i was hearing about it 
 but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit 
 judging her past and shit well its completely my future 
 her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit 
 and imma need that forty dollars even if i gotta 
 fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot 
 gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three 
 my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys 
 matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es 
 he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week 
 this is the life of another girl damaged by the system 
 these foster homes i run away and never do miss em 
 see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back 
 to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim 
 of a family gene that show women how to be woman 
 or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin 
 then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught 
 three niggas in one room first time i was tossed 
 and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit 
 my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain 
 if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait 
 your rebuttal a little too late 
 and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song 
 cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own 
 and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great 
 a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight 
 ill probably live longer than you and never fade away 
 ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate 
 and im on the grind for this cake imma get it or die trying 
 im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying 
 you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help em 
 with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga 
 dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga 
 when the lights shut off

 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself 
 am i really scared of passing away if its today i hope i hear a 
 cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon 
 with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus 
 i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline 
 reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance 
 with the other side may come soon and if im doomed 
 may the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons 
 i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror 
 get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots 
 and im not sure why im infatuated with death 
 my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats 
 that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful 
 and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch 
 maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death 
 really stuck in the schema of wondering when imma rest 
 and youre right your brother was a brother to me 
 and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me 
 in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen 
 by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between 
 her personal life i was like it need to be told 
 cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul 
 exactly whatd happen if i aint continued rappin 
 or steady being distracted by money drugs and four 
 fives i count lives all on these songs 
 look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong 
 fighting for your rights even when youre wrong 
 and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone 
 am i worth it 
 did i put enough work in 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me promise that youll sing about me forever 
 promise that youll sing about me forooooh

 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes only 
 for your eyes for your eyes only hey 
 niggas be dying on the daily 
 it seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly 
 cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal 
 control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal 
 cause young niggas is hard headed they letting off 
 full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause 
 aint no coming back family dressed in black 
 plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack 
 and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet 
 like i aint out in the field like that 
 i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back 
 despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless 
 screaming fuck the law my life is lawless 
 thats what you call it 
 aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven 
 this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic 
 i try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless 
 but these felonies be making life the hardest 
 resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet 
 or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it 
 thats why i write this sonnet 
 if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break 
 play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it 
 let her know my life is on it 
 for your eyes 
 let her know my life is on 
 for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me youre probably grown now so this songll hit you 
 if youre hearing this it means unfortunately im no longer with you 
 in the physical not even sure if i believe in god 
 but because you still alive 
 he got me praying that the spiritual is real 
 so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too 
 so i know how part of you feels 
 maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me 
 life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me 
 i hope not im tired of dope spots 
 and fiends that smoke rocks 
 ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot 
 im writing this cause me and the devil had a dance 
 i see death round the corner apologizing in advance 
 dont know if i ever had a chance 
 at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia 
 but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once 
 innocence disappeared by the age of eight years 
 my pops shot up drug related 
 mama addicted 
 so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging 
 blood was staining the concrete 
 older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet 
 that slow money picked up the family business 
 by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence 
 round the same time you came in this world 
 me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl 
 i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of 
 for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen 
 i was nineteen it took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me 
 and now its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that were never set for me 
 im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps catching up to me 
 and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me in several ways i couldve went out too many to count 
 was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
 was it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out 
 niggas dont know how to act in a drought 
 see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed 
 my views misshaped by new mixtapes 
 that confirmed the shit i learned from in the streets was true 
 that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you 
 they just pull up on your street let the heat have you 
 and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food 
 i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops 
 ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you 
 i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views 
 much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you 
 into a box where your son dont even know his pops 
 and the cyclical nature of doing time continues 
 my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news 
 i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon 
 and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true 
 but maybe theres a chance that its not 
 and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels 
 and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes 
 i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you 
 for your eyes only for your eyes 
 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes 
 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes do you understand one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling 
 what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling 
 i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing 
 but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling 
 he said jermaine i knew since we was children i never asked for nothing 
 when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me 
 i dealt with the repercussions of my actions 
 i know you tried to steer me away from that shit 
 but that shit was in my blood you know my life 
 i know your momma nigga send my love 
 in case i never get a chance to speak again 
 i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib 
 thats the way i wished my family lived 
 but my granny crib was in the jects 
 i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at 
 he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions 
 but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side 
 i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed 
 with that said im proud to say i was a father 
 write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready 
 so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch it disrespect it 
 this perspective is a real one another lost ville son 
 i dedicate these words to you and all the other children 
 affected by all the mass incarceration in this nation 
 that sent your pops to prison when he needed education 
 sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better 
 although that means i would never be brought into this world cos my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with 
 little zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told 
 girl your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was cold 
 not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old 
 not becuase he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues 
 not cause he went from bagging up them grams to serving os 
 now your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was hard 
 not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars 
 not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true 
 your daddy was a real nigga cos he loved you 
 for your eyes only",yeah for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only hey niggas be dying on the daily it seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal cause young niggas is hard headed they letting off full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause aint no coming back family dressed in black plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet like i aint out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screaming fuck the law my life is lawless thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless but these felonies be making life the hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it let her know my life is on it for your eyes let her know my life is on for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me youre probably grown now so this songll hit you if youre hearing this it means unfortunately im no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me praying that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me i hope not im tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot im writing this cause me and the devil had a dance i see death round the corner apologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen it took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that were never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me in several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned from in the streets was true that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat have you and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me away from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch it disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by all the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better although that means i would never be brought into this world cos my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with little zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old not becuase he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not cause he went from bagging up them grams to serving os now your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cos he loved you for your eyes

 and turned to the greatest i proved that already 
 and if you would like i do it twice 
 i just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways 
 this for my niggas that was tossin the graves 
 every so often i fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days 
 we used to play before your coffin was made 
 just got the call nigga got caught with a stray 
 hope hes okay 
 just got paid what cochran got paid to free oj 
 just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers 
 who know a nigga far too well and thats the danger 
 know me better than i know myself 
 i rip a page out my notebook in anger 
 and let these thoughts linger singing dont give em too much you 
 dont let em take control 
 its one thing you do 
 dont let em taint your soul 
 if you believe in god 
 one things for sure 
 if you aint aim too high 
 then you aim too low whats the price for a black man life 
 i check the toe tag not one zero in sight 
 i turn the tv on not one hero in sight 
 unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics 
 look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights cameras and action 
 may no man alive come through and damage my faction 
 i brought you niggas with me cause i love you like my brothers 
 and your mothers like my mother 
 think we need a plan of action 
 the bigger we get the more likely egos collide 
 its just physics please lets put our egos aside 
 you my niggas and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies 
 i hope that we remember these 
 nights fulla hennessey 
 when hov around we switch up to that dusse 
 gotta show respect one day we tryna stay where you stay 
 cause we from where you from

 im talkin bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb 
 keep a black nigga dyin by a black nigga gun 
 and keep on listening to the frontin ass rap niggas son

 and talked about how we gon smash all the bitches in class 
 i complimented how i see him out here getting his cash and just asked what a nigga gotta do to get that put me on

 and thought about how far we done came

 money my motivator the songs that i sing 
 picture a peasant passin from pawn to king 
 you tell me ya love me and if so then let me go 
 will i turn or will i burn well never know who is the king 
 look at my eyes and see a future but dont sugar code it but dont sugar code 
 it 
 listen history repeats itself and thats just how it goes 
 same with that these rappers always bite each others flows 
 same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock n roll 
 justin timberlake eminem and then macklemore 
 while silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown 
 look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound 
 this year ill probably go to the awards dapper down 
 watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile 
 im just playin 
 but all good jokes contain true shit 
 same rope you climb up on they hang you with 
 but not jeremaine my aim too sick 
 i bang nigga i came to bring the pain my brain too quick 
 you see how i maneuver this game i aint stupid 
 i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid 
 and break the chain and change minds 
 one verse at a time and claim too sick 
 and fuck it if the shoe 
 who is the king 
 we all kings we all kings nigga 
 kings of ourselves first and foremost true 
 while people debate whos the king of this rap game 
 here comes lil o jeremaine 
 with every ounce of strenght in his veins 
 to snatch the crown from who ever yall think has it 
 but than rather to place it on his head as soon as he grabs it 
 poof boom poaw its like magic 
 with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates 
 and falls to the earth from which it came 
 its done 
 aint gonna be no more kings 
 be wary of any man that claims 
 because deep down he clings onto the need for power 
 but in reality hes a coward 
 ultimately hes scared to die 
 and sometimes so am i 
 but when in tune with the most high 
 i realize that fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side 
 today i know we are the same 
 are the same you and i 
 different kind of skin different set of eyes 
 two different minds but only one god its only one god nigga 
 its all for the kings

 youre the one that was trying to keep me way down 
 but like the sun know you know i found my way back round they tell me i should fix my grill cause i got money now 
 i aint gon sit around and front like i aint thought about it 
 a perfect smile is more appealing but its funny how 
 my shit is crooked look at how far i done got without it 
 i keep my twisted grill just to show them kids its real 
 we aint picture perfect but we worth the picture still 
 i got smart i got rich and i got bitches still 
 and they all look like my eyebrows thick as hell 
 love yourself girl or nobody will 
 oh you a woman i dont know how you deal 
 with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels 
 i feel for you 
 killing yourself to find a man thatll kill for you 
 you wake up put makeup on 
 stare in the mirror but its clear that you cant face whats wrong 
 no need to fix what god already put his paint brush on 
 your roommate yelling why you gotta take so long 
 what its like to have a crooked smile im on my way on my way on my way down 
 on my way on my way on my way down 
 youre the one that was trying to keep me way down 
 but like the sun know you know i found my way back round to all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling 
 you wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling 
 you keep falling victim cause youre insecure 
 and when i tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure 
 cause he dont seem to want you back 
 and it got you asking 
 so all you see is what you lacking 
 not what you packing 
 take it from a man that loves what you got 
 and baby girl youre a star dont let em tell you youre not 
 now is it real eyebrows fingernails hair 
 is it real if its not girl you dont care 
 cause whats real is something that the eyes cant see 
 that the hands cant touch 
 that them broads cant be and thats you 
 never let em see you frown 
 and if you need a friend to pick you up ill be around 
 and we can ride with the windows down the music loud 
 i can tell you aint laughed in a while 
 but i wanna see that crooked smile im on my way on my way on my way down 
 on my way on my way on my way down 
 youre the one that was trying to keep me way down 
 but like the sun know you know i found my way back round crooked smile we could style on em back round 
 crooked smile we could style on em back round 
 youre the one that was trying to keep me way down 
 like the sun i know you know i found my way back round we dont look nothing like the people on the screen 
 you know them movie stars picture perfect beauty queens 
 but we got dreams and we got the right to chase em 
 look at the nation thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten 
 seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail 
 wonder why we inhale cause we in hell already 
 i asked if my skin pale would i then sell like eminem or adele 
 yo one more time for the ville 
 and fuck all of that beef shit nigga lets make a mil 
 hey officer man we dont want nobody getting killed

 a babys bein born same time a man is murdered 
 the beginning and end so far as rap goes 
 its only natural i explain my plateau 
 and also what defines my name yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin no id my mentor now let the story begin i used to print out nas raps and tape em up on my wall 
 my niggas thought they was words but it was pictures i saw 
 and since i wanted to draw i used to read em in awe 
 then he dropped stillmatic rocked the cleanest velour 
 fast forward who thought that i would meet him on tour 
 im earnin stripes now nigga got adidas galore 
 backstage i shis hand let him know that hes the man 
 when he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand 
 no time to soak up the moment though cause i was in a jam 
 hov askin wheres the record that the radio could play 
 and i was strikin out for months 9th inning feeling fear 
 jeter under pressure made the biggest hit of my career 
 but at first that wasnt clear niggas had no idea 
 dion called me when it dropped sounded sad but sincere told me nas heard your single and he hate that shit 
 said you the one yo why you make that shit 
 i cant believe i let nas down damn my heart sunk to my stomach i cant believe i let nas down 
 i got defensive on the phone resentment was in my tone fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin 
 no id my mentor now let the story begin 
 i couldnt help but think that maybe i had made a mistake 
 i mean you made you owe me dog i thought that you could relate 
 but while i shot up the charts you mean tellin me 
 that i was not up to par when i followed my heart 
 granted my heart was tainted by my mind i kept on sayin 
 wheres the hits you aint got none 
 you know jay would never put your album out without none 
 and dog you know how come 
 labels are archaic formulaic with their outcomes 
 they dont know they just study the charts 
 me i study the shows the fans study their hearts 
 i had a feelin i was killin and this music we were spillin out would change lives forever fuck the label put it out friday night lights blew that was classic number 2 
 now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin true 
 still no release date from the label are they insane 
 gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way i let nas down i got no one to blame im ashamed i let nas down but this is gods plan you could never understand fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible 
 now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin 
 no id my mentor now let the story begin 
 i always believed in the bigger picture 
 if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core then i can open a door 
 reintroduce em to honesty show em that they need more 
 the difference between the pretenders and the kendrick lamars 
 and so i took the fall like the son of the lord 
 on the cross dyin for that fake shit you niggas bought 
 for the past decade if i should pass please let this be my last essay 
 therefore i write from the heart 
 apologies to ogs for sacrificin my art 
 but im here for a greater purpose i knew right from the start 
 im just a man of the people not above but equal 
 and for the greater good i walk amongst the evil 
 dont cry mama this the life i choose myself 
 just pray along the way that i dont lose myself 
 this is for the nigga that said that hiphop was dead 
 i went to hell to resurrect it how could you fail to respect it 
 lettin nas down i got the phone call quietly i mourned dog i let nas down 
 yeah and on this flight may i never lose sight fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals

 should this be my last breath im blessed cause it was purposeful 
 never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful 
 you made me versatile wellrounded like cursive 
 know you chose me for a purpose i put my soul in these verses 
 born sinner was never born to be perfect 
 sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses 
 back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers 
 teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless 
 and violent and hopeless 
 i saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be 
 all you can be posters 
 rest in peace to tiffany i dont know if this is the realest shit i wrote 
 but know that the realest nigga wrote this 
 and signed it and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you would find it 
 and knew one day that you would come back and rewind this singing im a born sinner 
 but i die better than that swear 
 you were always where i needed you to be 
 whether you were there or not there i was there 
 i was born sinning 
 but i live better than that better tonight 
 if you aint fucking with that i dont care yeah yeah yeah yeah this music shit is a gift 
 but god help us make it cause this music business is a cliff 
 i got a life in my grip she holding tight to my wrist 
 she screaming dont let me slip 
 she see the tears in my eyes i see the fear on her lips 
 true when i told you you the only reason why i dont flip and go insane 
 my roof in the pouring rain 
 you knew me before the fame dont lose me the more i change 
 no just grow with me go broke you go broke with me 
 i smoke you gon smoke with me 
 womans curse since birth man lead her to the hearse 
 i go bobby you go with me damn 
 listen here ill tell you my biggest fears 
 you the only one who knows them 
 dont you ever go expose them 
 this life is harder than youll probably ever know 
 emotions i hardly ever show 
 more for you than for me 
 dont you worry yourself 
 i gotta do this for me 
 they tell me life is a test but wheres a tutor for me 
 pops came late im already stuck in my ways 
 ducking calls from my mother for days 
 sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised cant wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say 
 except im a born sinner 
 but i die better than that swear 
 you were always where i needed you to be 
 whether you were there or not there i was there

 so many things you could have told me 
 and saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me 
 i feel like you barely know me 
 and thats a shame cause our last name is the same 
 that blood type flowing through our veins is the same 
 my mama left you and it may be that angers to blame 
 but thats no excuse only you and god know the truth 
 and why you only call monthly barely ever saw me

 and it feels like a quarterback get sacked and then you fumble 
 jobs dont call a nigga back so its back to the hustle 
 niggas praying for they moms 
 at the same time they moms pray for them 
 ask the lord to stay with them guide them on they way 
 but damn a nigga been a lost fate 
 it hurts on the usual 
 the only time you catch me up at church is a funeral sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga 
 the same ones you love will bring you pain my nigga

 and in this life times getting hard my nigga 
 but fuck that im aiming for the stars my nigga 
 i wont stop try til the day i die 
 and i wont cry no i cant cry no i sit back and watch the news every now and then 
 either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash 
 even the weathers bad 
 it be the same shit got my brain twisted 
 like damn its 06 and niggas still up on that gang shit 
 yesterday this kid got his whole frame split 
 only seventeen he was finna graduate in like three weeks 
 some stupid niggas got him for his chain 
 but he fought back they blasted him and left him on the pavement 
 and now they telling me this little girl just got raped

 neighborhoods looking like theres still segregation 
 welfare single mothers no jobs 
 tryna get a piece for yourself but they hogging up the whole pie 
 fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit 
 this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress 
 white folks got the road to success mapped and thats all good 
 but why dont blacks got that same atlas 
 i asked the same question a million ways 
 and it seems like i had prayed for a million days 
 still the ills remain just bills and pain 
 shoot outs and project buildings children slain 
 skies filled with rain and i just sit and wonder why 
 its enough to make a nigga wanna cry

 like everybody passing through the studio is in character 
 as if he acting out a movie role 
 talking bullshit as if it was for you to know 
 and i dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go 
 so they stick around kicking out feedback 
 and i entertain it is if i need that 
 i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that 
 my privacy about the only thing i need back 
 but its hard thinkin in polite flows 
 when stephano polato suits are your night clothes 
 and jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes 
 and you still make it even when they say your flight close 
 eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows 
 life was so full now the shit just been lypod 
 always said ill say it all on the right track 
 but in this game you only lose when you fight back 
 black diamond bracelets showing you the basics 
 i cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this 
 i make hits and like a bitch thats married i aint miss 
 24 hours from greatness im that close 
 dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt 
 transitioning from fitting in to standing out 
 los angeles cabanas or atlanta south 
 watch hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out 
 and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out 
 so i park about 5 houses down 
 she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown 
 but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around 
 so she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus 
 and yet i role around the fucking city like ya highness 
 got niggaz reacting without a sinus 
 cause what im working with is timeless 
 and promoters trying to get me out to they club 
 and say i have fun but i cant imagine how 
 cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fucking right now 
 and shit can get weird unless they all down 
 and so i stay clear we from a small town 
 and everybody talks and everybody listen 
 and somehow the truth just always comes up missing 
 ive always been something that these labels cant buy 
 especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul 
 and silvia be telling taz damn drake fly 
 and he just be like silly motherfucker i know 
 that was your bad how can you pass up on em 
 he just take them records and he gas up on em 
 wayne would probably put a million cash up on em 
 surprised no one ever put your ass up on em 
 oh they did po at least they tried to 
 and thats what happen when you spitting what inside you 
 but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video 
 and they think they can market you however they decide to 
 nah before they told me to do me 
 and dont listen to anybody that knew me 
 cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me 
 and if you think i changed in the slightest could have fooled me 
 boy and to my city im the two three 
 drug dealers live vicariously through me 
 i quit school and its not because im lazy 
 im just not the social type and campus life is crazy 
 understand i could get money with my eyes closed 
 lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo 
 so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll 
 sell that motherfucker to any rapper that i know 
 cause they need it much more than i ever will 
 i got new shit im getting better still 
 little niggaz put my name in they verses 
 cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal 
 future said cause its ye shit you better kill 
 and i think this got that making of a legend feel

 mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm i think this is the part where im supposed to say something good 
 to compensate it so it doesnt come off bad 
 but sometimes i think really bad things 
 really really 
 really bad things and i love myself way more than i love you 
 see if i was trying to relate it to more people 
 id probably say im struggling with loving myself

 and at this rate we gon both die broke 
 got friends that ask me for money knowin im in debt 
 and like my wife said i still didnt say no 
 people tryna say im goin crazy on twitter 
 my friends best advice was to stay low 
 i guess its hard to decipher all of the bills 
 especially when you got family members on payroll 
 the media said it was outlandish spendin 
 the media said hes way out of control 
 i just feel like im the only one not pretendin 
 im not out of control im just not in they control 
 i know im the most influential 
 that time cover was just confirmation 
 this generations closest thing to einstein 
 so dont worry about me im fine 
 i can see a thousand years from now in real life 
 skate on the paradigm and shift it when i feel like 
 troll conventional thought dont need to question 
 i know its antiquated so sometimes i get aggressive 
 thank god for jay electra he down with the mission 
 did it with with no permission on our own conditions 
 most blacks with money have been beaten to submission 
 yeezy with the big house did it way different 
 never listen to hollywood producers 
 dont stare at money too long its medusa 
 the ultimate gemini has survived 
 i wasnt supposed to make it past 25 and youre lookin at the church in the night sky

 black on black lies is worse than black on black crime 
 the jews share their truth on how to make a dime 
 most black men couldnt balance a checkbook 
 but buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look 
 well it all looks great 
 four hundred years later we buyin our own chains 
 the light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard 
 real family stick together and see through the mirage 
 the smokescreens perceptions of false reality

 i am one with the people 
 i am one with the people real 
 ive been woken from enlightened mans dream 
 checkin instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem 
 let me not say too much or do too much

 and the new word to have is revolution 
 people dont even want to hear the preacher 
 spill or spiel because gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued 
 and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey 
 the youngsters who were programmed to continue 
 fucking up woke up one night digging 
 paul revere and nat turner as the good guys 
 america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes 
 the signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina 
 we learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal 
 two long centuries buried in the musty vault 
 hosed down daily with a gagging perfume 
 america was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
 whose legs were then spread around the world 
 and a rapist known as freedom free doom 
 democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names 
 that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling

 and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him 
 i played my little songs in that old back room

 partyin sobs and we had packed the crowd 
 big brother got a show up in madison square 
 and im like yeah yeah we gon be there 
 but not only did i not get a chance to spit it carlene told me i could buy two tickets 
 i guess big brother was thinkin a little different 
 and kept little brother at bay at a distance 
 but everything that i felt was more bogus only made me more focused only wrote more potent 
 only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over 
 i guess i understand when i get more older 
 big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

 and we know new jack city gotta keep my brother 
 but to be number one ima beat my brother 
 on that diamonds remix i swore id spaz 
 then my big brother came through and kicked my ass 
 sibling rivalry only i could see it was the pride in me that was drivin me 
 at the grammies i said i inspired me 
 but my big brother who i always tried to be when i kicked the flow it was like pick and roll 
 cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go 
 i guess being styled was more of a slam dunk 
 and my shit was more like a finger roll but i had them singles though 
 and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo laughs yall know 
 i told jay i did a song with coldplay 
 next thing i know he got a song with coldplay 
 back of my mind im like damn no way

 should have known that was gonna come back around 
 should have talked to you like a man should have told you first 
 but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse 
 my big brother was bigs brother 
 so heres a few words from your kid brother
