 learned to sing inside the lords house but stopped the age of nine 
 i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride 
 the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind 
 so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 and when the worlds against me is when i really come alive 
 and every day that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride 
 you know that ive got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs 
 i think life has got to the point i know without its no fun 
 i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
 instead i look in the mirror questioning what ive become 
 guess its a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 without a ninetofive job or a uni degree 
 to be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 show me the locked doors ill find another use for the key 
 and youll see 
 
 
 im well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 but with that said give me one more 
 
 
 another one to take the sting away 
 i am happy on my own so here ill stay 
 save your lovin arms for a rainy day 
 and ill find comfort in my pain eraser 
 
 
 i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong 
 i think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell 
 relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well 
 and aint nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 because youre living your dream man this shit should be fun 
 please know that im not trying to preach like im reverend run 
 i beg you dont be disappointed with the man ive become 
 conversations with my father on the a14 
 age 12 telling me ive gotta chase those dreams 
 now im playing for the people dad and they know me 
 with my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
 wembley stadium crowds 240 thou 
 i may have grown up but i hope that damians proud 
 and to the next generation inspirations allowed 
 the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now 
 somehow

 bit of a catch to have a local girl 
 hair tied up in elastic band 
 with a kiss on the cheek for her onenight man 
 
 
 i don’t wanna go alone 
 i don’t wanna go alone 
 no i dont wanna go alone 
 
 
 tell her that i love her tell her that i need her 
 tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand 
 tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair 
 all i wanna do is be near 
 tell her that i want her tell her that i need her 
 tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand 
 tell her that i love her more than anyone else 
 if you don’t i’ll tell her myself 
 
 
 and we’ve got that love in us and were the drink killers 
 we’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers 
 if we talk outside say hey whats new 
 i don’t really dance so i’ll just watch you 
 are you taking me back tonight tell me if that’s alright 
 i don’t wanna be here i’m not the sofa type 
 tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing 
 she said i wanna take off what you’re wearing 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 she’s like the fast food i’ll regret it after 
 and i needed money but i’m too shy to ask her 
 but she buys me chips and cheese 
 so i tell her that she’s all i need 
 
 
 tell her that i tell her that i 
 tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand 
 tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair 
 all i wanna do is be near 
 tell her that i tell her that i 
 tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand

 awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon 
 cause i heard that time waits for nobody i suppose its true 
 we make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves 
 i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme 
 so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 and ill be sticking to this phrase until i pass away 
 overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 but ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
 
 
 5 oclock with lights off interview with a vampire 
 sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require 
 i swear i said that ill sleep when im dead 
 whos on the beat upon the feature with ed 
 its dev to the zed 
 over tired pale faced like michael myers 
 bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage ive acquired 
 and over the time within this maze i think youll find youll 
 never find that peace of mind you seek to find until youre dying 
 cause i got too much to stay awake for 
 to sleep or even take four seconds out the game its time to wage war 
 scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 im hailing from the essex and the east london border line 
 villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 be wide awake just like youre snorting lines 
 or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of jesus walking by 
 
 
 i never sleep 
 when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 it could be 
 the times im living in 
 i never sleep 
 when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 it could be

 i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth 
 and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 deliver the raps how i flow i live with the rats now and those 
 that hate me call me ron but they wont slither in too easy 
 believe me im snake minded be within this great time be 
 on minimum wage life is a prison escape that im in 
 its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows 
 some of the songs i write are real because the charts are filled with silicone 
 im still broke without the money for a mac pro 
 living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow 
 opposite of sober cause i never did my homework 
 which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older 
 i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie 
 i wake dead take deep breaths try to never die never die 
 
 
 two guys with the same view keep it tight like scrooge 
 making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes 
 and if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze 
 times elapsing while youre catching zeds the masses like to move 
 we scan the situation analyse information 
 and then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 driven young gentlemen ive hardly changed my bed sheets 
 at all over the last 12 months cause i havent slept in em true 
 im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so im correcting em 
 we got the fans all like oh wow its devs and ed 
 what less did you bloody expect from em 
 in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 fighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock 
 and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got 
 i keep my pupils engaged 
 like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake 
 
 
 i never sleep

 to see my family 
 please father let me go 
 as my mother sleeps 
 
 
 i dont know about james bond 
 but round here nobody lives twice 
 when youre gone youre gone without no bye 
 cause only a judge can give you life 
 this is my advice 
 trust me i nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after i got this ride 
 pissed like i had way too much wine 
 wished i didnt get one 
 anyway i was going to the macbeth booked for a set 
 even though i didnt have a set one 
 skream hit the decks i was like check one 
 put on a show but it werent my best one 
 left it dropped off blacks at his destination 
 then i was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later i was on the m1 
 tired but i kept on going 
 fell asleep without even knowing 
 no motion in my face 
 no movement in my legs but the car still kept going 
 woke up lorry flash 
 panic break skid crash 
 skidded more bang smash 
 out cold ribs cracked ouch 
 i was in so much pain 
 crawled out of a mégane that now looked like a mini 
 when i was still on the first lane 
 baffled didnt even know my name 
 fainted too much shock in my brain 
 surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 trying to get up but fainted again 
 
 
 see i just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 dont think im happy cos i smile when you see me out 
 ive had serious madnesses where ive nearly disappeared 
 and im begging lord to save me and let me go 
 
 
 to see my family 
 and keep it inside 
 dry eyes while my brother weeps 
 save my soul 
 please father let me go 
 keep me safe as my mother sleeps 
 
 
 eyes closed they just wouldnt open 
 i could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 fighting for life cant tell if im winning 
 one of the worst situations ive been in 
 i could hear all of the angels singing 
 but when they stopped humming 
 my brain turned on started running 
 still in pain but it started numbing 
 the stone cold comeback i made was stunning 
 i still tried to do a few shows cos i didnt wanna tell them that i werent coming 
 but i was left with a permanent problem 
 nobody knows about the pain that im in sly 
 ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later jogging and running 
 i used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming 
 trust me when it comes to mistakes 
 you cant afford to let one in 
 never done tunes for a while 
 the pipeline was blocked 
 so i learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 they say tomorrow never dies 
 but they forgot to tell you you can 
 you can have a sicker clan than wutang 
 but when your times up thats it its you fam 
 you can try beg for another 
 sometimes ill be on my way to a show 
 thinking i just wanna see my brother 
 then do a uturn im gone one up

 this is just the worst way to spend your birthday its 30 degrees thursday 
 you work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes 
 lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night 
 you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 and you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 youll make a trip to the whittington where theyll look at your jaw 
 theyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 theyll know youre fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 but young woman the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldnt 
 ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him 
 cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
 
 
 shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 and she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 
 
 little lady your mind youve made up 
 your injuries you cant hide with makeup 
 you need some medical advice you make up a little lie to say just 
 in case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb 
 with any luck youll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 last year when your pimp just lost it 
 he wouldnt recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 cause all the heroin is making you age 
 but youre a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram 
 mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 little does she know youre never coming back 
 she put you in her brothers hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 hes the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer 
 fancy that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn 
 
 
 shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 and she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 
 
 an angel will die 
 covered in white 
 closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 this time well fade out tonight 
 straight down the line 
 
 
 little lady youre trembling with fear 
 your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 youre sitting facing the detective oh dear 
 the meddling nurse couldnt just leave it 
 shes only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 shell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused 
 youre causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 the cop is trying to calm you telling you he wont let no one harm you 
 the same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for 
 hes talking to you like youre worth more than a dirty whore 
 youre having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 youre learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 its kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before 
 just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that its hard 
 he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 begs you to use it hes useless if youre gonna be stupid 
 cause an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips youre on your own 
 youve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 you reach your door and then it dawns that youve been followed home 
 before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 and then a voice says where you been bitch i wanna know 
 no prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness 
 you open the front door he boots you in 
 theres something new in him hes silent now that fills you with terror 
 get your alibi straight you could be killed for an error 
 he towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 at this point your life flashes before your eyes your handbags dropped 
 and all the contents are all over the floor 
 despite the mess theres only one thing thats caught his eye 
 and in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece 
 and dumps her body in the boot of his mercs in the street 
 little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 all because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
 
 
 and were all under the upper hand 
 and go mad for a couple grams 
 and we dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 for angels to fly 
 fly fly

 i just wanted to let you know hmm 
 
 
 i hope you can hear what i write to you 
 how could i say goodbye to you 
 when im a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 i gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam 
 you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels 
 plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 just locked in a cage slaving 
 they said they were gold in the pavements 
 but you came and saw the road to amazement 
 broke your heart 
 but still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 i hope your listening right 
 i still think of you every sunday 
 no one can top your chicken and rice 
 even through the darkness times 
 you held us all up because your vision was bright 
 i knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 you never let anyone see your heartache 
 you just got on with it 
 anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 and your words you would stand strong with it 
 cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 but i was just too young to go on with it 
 and there somethings i could try to do 
 but its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 i couldnt do that i owe my life to you 
 
 
 and of the pieces of my soul 
 because i need a sign i hope this pain will heal in time 
 you know i never want to be aloohohone 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there 
 can i say goodbye to you 
 and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace 
 can i say goodbye to you ohh 
 
 
 i think you phoney 
 i was younger with the knowledge of things that i know now 
 i would be by your side when you needed me 
 instead of asking you nan can i go out 
 standing in a road with the gangs that i know now 
 everyones missing you loads jessicas grown up 
 warreen lauren and alex are fine and im living with hope 
 its been a while since ive seen c and the mouths 
 i miss seeing a family being a family 
 and us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 but as time goes by the bridge seems longer 
 family problems have never been funny 
 in my heart the only one that dissed me was sonia 
 she took all our inheritance money 
 left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 i never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 there aint a big enough reason 
 before i sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing 
 but i guess that everyones different 
 or should i say no ones perfect 
 she had happiness in front of her 
 but chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 so building it back up is my next step 
 i got all the bricks and the cement but 
 its hard when its done i dont know what to expect 
 so give me the strength that i need to perform this task 
 make it right i must do 
 and i ask cause i trust you 
 it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you 
 
 
 and of the pieces of my soul 
 because i need a sign i hope this pain will heal in time 
 you know i never want to be aloohohone 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there 
 can i say goodbye to you 
 and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace 
 can i say goodbye to you ohh 
 
 
 its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but 
 i miss you oh how i miss you 
 its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but 
 i miss you oh how i miss you 
 
 
 there aint enough words to describe 
 how sorry i am for the pain that i caused 
 sorry for when i stuck up my own blood 
 we were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 and for the day police came to the door 
 im sorry for being such a bad youth 
 stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 i never been able to say this before 
 cause i was so inconsiderate 
 you loved me unconditionally 
 and i took advantage of it like a idiot 
 not seeing the pure soul that i was living with 
 i really hope that you can forgive me 
 you going away was a punishment 
 but i wont let go im holding you with me 
 but i still fight the emotions within me 
 
 
 i can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air

 could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder 
 under the covers where we used to lay 
 and re stacks is what the speakers played 
 id be on tour almost every day 
 when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay 
 just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed 
 getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe 
 we used each others air just for the people to see 
 and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 we go anywhere our minds would take us 
 and ill say you are beautiful without your makeup 
 and you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause 
 we can all be loved the way that god made us 
 and times the only reason that we could break up 
 cause you would always tell me im away too much 
 distance is relative to the time that it takes 
 to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again 
 
 
 oh nina 
 you should go nina 
 cause i aint never coming home nina 
 oh wont you leave me now 
 and ive been living on the road nina 
 but then again you should know nina 
 cause that’s you and me both nina 
 oh wont you leave me now now 
 
 
 and every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie 
 with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 taking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own 
 cause every day when i was away wed only speak on the phone 
 watching blue planet creating new habits 
 acting as if we were two rabbits and then youd vanish 
 back to the burrow with all the celtics 
 i disappear you call me selfish 
 i understand but i can’t help it 
 i put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 but youll be in between forever so i guess well have to take a step back 
 overlook the situation 
 cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
 and im not saying we should be taking a break 
 just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late 
 so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane 
 but in a day well have to say it again

 but you cant make it on your own

 just wish youd never gone for the man 
 and waited two weeks at least 
 before you let him take you 
 i stayed true i kind of knew 
 you liked the dude from private school 
 hes waiting for the time to move 
 i knew he had his eyes on you 
 hes not the right guy for you 
 dont hate me cause i write the truth 
 no i would never lie to you 
 but it was never fine to lose you 
 and what a way to find out 
 it never came from my mouth 
 you never changed your mind 
 but you were just afraid to mind out 
 but it 
 i wont be changing the subject i love it 
 ill make your little secret public 
 its nothing im just disgusted with the skeletons 
 you sleep with in your closet to get back at me 
 trapped and im lacking sleep 
 fact is youre mad at me 
 because i backtrack so casually 
 youre practically my family 
 if we married then ill guess youd have to be 
 but tragically our love just lost the will to live 
 but would i kill to give it one more shot 
 i think not 
 
 
 i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no 
 anymore

 i dont wanna love you no

 recently i tend to zone out 
 up in my headphones to holocene 
 you promised your body but im away so much 
 i stay more celibate than in a monastery 
 im not cut out for life on the road 
 cause i didnt know id miss you this much 
 and at the time wed just go so sue me 
 i guess im not the man that you need 
 ever since you went to uni 
 ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
 full of less cash and i guess that could get bad 
 but when i broke the industry 
 thats when i broke your heart 
 i was supposed to chart and celebrate 
 but good things are over fast 
 i know its hard to deal with and see this 
 i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
 then i turn the music off 
 and all im left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus 
 i never really want to believe this 
 got advice from my dad and he 
 told me that family is all ill ever have and need 
 i guess im unaware of it 
 success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with 
 
 
 i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no 
 anymore 
 i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont wanna love you no 
 anymore 
 
 
 and since you left ive given up my days off 
 its what i need to stay strong 
 i know you have a day job but mine is 247 
 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook 
 cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could 
 the irony is if my career in music didnt exist 
 in 6 years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid 
 im frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink 
 and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and its 
 just hiding my misguiding thoughts that im trying to kill 
 and id be writing my will before im 27 ill die from a thrill 
 go down in history as just a wasted talent 
 can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing 
 its only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me 
 eventually ill be fine i know that it was never meant to be 
 either way i guess im not prepared but ill say this 
 these things happen for a reason and you cant change 
 take my apology im sorry for the honesty 
 but i had to get this off my chest

 i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no

 tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school 
 ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop 
 bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes 
 ill give you the truth through the vocal booth 
 and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit 
 they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot 
 but then again thats what theyre supposed to do 
 and im supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 whispering everything that happens is from now on 
 ill be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 and still theyre claiming that i handle it wrong 
 but then ive never had an enemy except the nme 
 but ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be 
 with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
 are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree 
 singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids

 taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus 
 putting on a brave face like timothy dalton 
 considering a name change thinking it was hopeless 
 rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 
 cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written 
 now absence can make your heart ache 
 but drinking absinthe can change your mind state 
 vividly need to let my liver be 
 and ill say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends 
 its good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me 
 and i hope to see him blowing up globally 
 cause thats how its supposed to be im screaming out vocally 
 it might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams but 
 but i just write schemes 
 im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans 
 madison square garden is where i might be but more likely 
 youll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates 
 having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made 
 and every single second knowing that well never betray 
 the way we were raised remembering our background sat down 
 thats how we plan it out its time to take it back now

 and maybe youre hoping for a fairytale too 
 and if your dvd breaks today

 and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv

 awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon 
 cause i heard that time waits for nobody i suppose its true 
 we make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves 
 i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme 
 so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 and ill be sticking to this phrase until i pass away 
 overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 but ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
 
 
 5 oclock with lights off interview with a vampire 
 sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require 
 i swear i said that ill sleep when im dead 
 whos on the beat upon the feature with ed 
 its dev to the zed 
 over tired pale faced like michael myers 
 bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage ive acquired 
 and over the time within this maze i think youll find youll 
 never find that peace of mind you seek to find until youre dying 
 cause i got too much to stay awake for 
 to sleep or even take four seconds out the game its time to wage war 
 scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 im hailing from the essex and the east london border line 
 villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 be wide awake just like youre snorting lines 
 or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of jesus walking by 
 
 
 i never sleep 
 when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 it could be 
 the times im living in 
 i never sleep 
 when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 it could be 
 the times im living in lately 
 
 
 i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth 
 and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 deliver the raps how i flow i live with the rats now and those 
 that hate me call me ron but they wont slither in too easy 
 believe me im snake minded be within this great time be 
 on minimum wage life is a prison escape that im in 
 its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows 
 some of the songs i write are real because the charts are filled with silicone 
 im still broke without the money for a mac pro 
 living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow 
 opposite of sober cause i never did my homework 
 which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older 
 i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie 
 i wake dead take deep breaths try to never die never die 
 
 
 two guys with the same view keep it tight like scrooge 
 making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes 
 and if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze 
 times elapsing while youre catching zeds the masses like to move 
 we scan the situation analyse information

 i dont know about james bond 
 but round here nobody lives twice 
 when youre gone youre gone without no bye 
 cause only a judge can give you life 
 this is my advice 
 trust me i nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after i got this ride 
 pissed like i had way too much wine 
 wished i didnt get one 
 anyway i was going to the macbeth booked for a set 
 even though i didnt have a set one 
 skream hit the decks i was like check one 
 put on a show but it werent my best one 
 left it dropped off blacks at his destination 
 then i was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later i was on the m1 
 tired but i kept on going 
 fell asleep without even knowing 
 no motion in my face 
 no movement in my legs but the car still kept going 
 woke up lorry flash 
 panic break skid crash 
 skidded more bang smash 
 out cold ribs cracked ouch 
 i was in so much pain 
 crawled out of a mégane that now looked like a mini 
 when i was still on the first lane 
 baffled didnt even know my name 
 fainted too much shock in my brain 
 surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 trying to get up but fainted again 
 
 
 see i just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 dont think im happy cos i smile when you see me out 
 ive had serious madnesses where ive nearly disappeared 
 and im begging lord to save me and let me go 
 
 
 to see my family 
 and keep it inside 
 dry eyes while my brother weeps 
 save my soul 
 please father let me go 
 keep me safe as my mother sleeps 
 
 
 eyes closed they just wouldnt open 
 i could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 fighting for life cant tell if im winning 
 one of the worst situations ive been in 
 i could hear all of the angels singing 
 but when they stopped humming 
 my brain turned on started running 
 still in pain but it started numbing 
 the stone cold comeback i made was stunning 
 i still tried to do a few shows cos i didnt wanna tell them that i werent coming 
 but i was left with a permanent problem 
 nobody knows about the pain that im in sly 
 ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later jogging and running 
 i used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming 
 trust me when it comes to mistakes 
 you cant afford to let one in 
 never done tunes for a while 
 the pipeline was blocked 
 so i learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 they say tomorrow never dies 
 but they forgot to tell you you can 
 you can have a sicker clan than wutang 
 but when your times up thats it its you fam 
 you can try beg for another 
 sometimes ill be on my way to a show 
 thinking i just wanna see my brother 
 then do a uturn im gone one up

 this is just the worst way to spend your birthday its 30 degrees thursday 
 you work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes 
 lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night 
 you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 and you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 youll make a trip to the whittington where theyll look at your jaw 
 theyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 theyll know youre fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 but young woman the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldnt 
 ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him 
 cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
 
 
 shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 and she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 
 
 little lady your mind youve made up 
 your injuries you cant hide with makeup 
 you need some medical advice you make up a little lie to say just 
 in case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb 
 with any luck youll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 last year when your pimp just lost it 
 he wouldnt recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 cause all the heroin is making you age 
 but youre a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram 
 mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 little does she know youre never coming back 
 she put you in her brothers hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 hes the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer 
 fancy that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn 
 
 
 shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 and she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 
 
 an angel will die 
 covered in white 
 closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 this time well fade out tonight 
 straight down the line 
 
 
 little lady youre trembling with fear 
 your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 youre sitting facing the detective oh dear 
 the meddling nurse couldnt just leave it 
 shes only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 shell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused 
 youre causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 the cop is trying to calm you telling you he wont let no one harm you 
 the same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for 
 hes talking to you like youre worth more than a dirty whore 
 youre having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 youre learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 its kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before 
 just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that its hard 
 he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 begs you to use it hes useless if youre gonna be stupid 
 cause an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips youre on your own 
 youve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 you reach your door and then it dawns that youve been followed home 
 before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 and then a voice says where you been bitch i wanna know 
 no prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness 
 you open the front door he boots you in 
 theres something new in him hes silent now that fills you with terror 
 get your alibi straight you could be killed for an error 
 he towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 at this point your life flashes before your eyes your handbags dropped 
 and all the contents are all over the floor 
 despite the mess theres only one thing thats caught his eye 
 and in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece 
 and dumps her body in the boot of his mercs in the street 
 little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 all because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
 
 
 and were all under the upper hand 
 and go mad for a couple grams 
 and we dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cause in a pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside 
 for angels to fly 
 for angels to fly 
 fly fly

 i just wanted to let you know hmm 
 
 
 i hope you can hear what i write to you 
 how could i say goodbye to you 
 when im a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 i gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam 
 you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels 
 plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 just locked in a cage slaving 
 they said they were gold in the pavements 
 but you came and saw the road to amazement 
 broke your heart 
 but still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 i hope your listening right 
 i still think of you every sunday 
 no one can top your chicken and rice 
 even through the darkness times 
 you held us all up because your vision was bright 
 i knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 you never let anyone see your heartache 
 you just got on with it 
 anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 and your words you would stand strong with it 
 cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 but i was just too young to go on with it 
 and there somethings i could try to do 
 but its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 i couldnt do that i owe my life to you 
 
 
 and of the pieces of my soul 
 because i need a sign i hope this pain will heal in time 
 you know i never want to be aloohohone 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there 
 can i say goodbye to you 
 and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace 
 can i say goodbye to you ohh 
 
 
 i think you phoney 
 i was younger with the knowledge of things that i know now 
 i would be by your side when you needed me 
 instead of asking you nan can i go out 
 standing in a road with the gangs that i know now 
 everyones missing you loads jessicas grown up 
 warreen lauren and alex are fine and im living with hope 
 its been a while since ive seen c and the mouths 
 i miss seeing a family being a family 
 and us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 but as time goes by the bridge seems longer 
 family problems have never been funny 
 in my heart the only one that dissed me was sonia 
 she took all our inheritance money 
 left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 i never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 there aint a big enough reason 
 before i sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing 
 but i guess that everyones different 
 or should i say no ones perfect 
 she had happiness in front of her 
 but chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 so building it back up is my next step 
 i got all the bricks and the cement but 
 its hard when its done i dont know what to expect 
 so give me the strength that i need to perform this task 
 make it right i must do 
 and i ask cause i trust you 
 it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you 
 
 
 and of the pieces of my soul 
 because i need a sign i hope this pain will heal in time 
 you know i never want to be aloohohone 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there 
 can i say goodbye to you 
 and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace

 its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but 
 i miss you oh how i miss you 
 its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but 
 i miss you oh how i miss you 
 
 
 there aint enough words to describe 
 how sorry i am for the pain that i caused 
 sorry for when i stuck up my own blood 
 we were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 and for the day police came to the door 
 im sorry for being such a bad youth 
 stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 i never been able to say this before 
 cause i was so inconsiderate 
 you loved me unconditionally 
 and i took advantage of it like a idiot 
 not seeing the pure soul that i was living with 
 i really hope that you can forgive me 
 you going away was a punishment 
 but i wont let go im holding you with me 
 but i still fight the emotions within me

 do with their death bury their parents strife

 if these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good 
 no boat i float better than he would 
 no life jacket i’m not the god of nazareth 
 but your flood can be misunderstood 
 walls telling me they full of pain resentment 
 need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 me i’m just a tenant 
 landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 these walls are vulnerable exclamation 
 interior pink color coordinated 
 i interrogated every nook and cranny 
 i mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me

 knock these walls down that’s my religion 
 walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 i suffocate then catch my second wind 
 i resonate in these walls 
 i don’t know how long i can wait in these walls 
 i’ve been on the streets too long 
 looking at you from the outside in 
 they sing the same old song 
 about how they walls always the cleanest

 burn accessories and stash them on the yard

 wall telling you that commissary is low 
 race wars happening no calling co 
 no calling your mother to save you 
 homies to say youre irrepetible not acceptable 
 your behavior is sammy the bull like 
 a killer that turned snitch 
 walls is telling me you a bitch 
 you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 that sentence so important 
 walls telling you to listen to sing about me 
 retaliation is strong you even dream bout me 
 killed my homeboy and god spared your life 
 dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 so when you play this song rewind the first verse 
 about me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 about me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 about me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 about her baby daddy currently serving life 
 and how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her

 been in it before internet had new acts 
 mimicking radios nemesis made me wack 
 my innocence limited the experience lacked 
 ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact 
 you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 remember scribblin scratchin diligent sentences backwards 
 visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 now i can live in a stadium pack it the fastest 
 gamblin benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic 
 spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion 
 winnin in every decision 
 kendrick is master that mastered it 
 isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction 
 pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
 thank god for rap i would say it got me a plaque 
 but whats better than that 
 the fact it brought me back home

 nappy afro gap in his smile 
 handmedown sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted 
 tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 breakin new laws mama passed on home trainin 
 he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language 
 you just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 oh i forgot dont kill my vibe thats right youre famous 
 i used to watch on channel 5 tv was taken 
 but never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it 
 its just a new trip take a glimpse of your familys ancestor 
 make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 and that was bullshit 
 i know your life is full of turmoil 
 spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you 
 i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you 
 if you resist ill back off quick go catch a flight or two 
 but if you pick destiny over rest in peace 
 then be an advocate tell your homies especially 
 to come back home

 20 on pump 6 dirty marcellus called me dumbo 
 20 years ago cant forget 
 now i can lend him a ear or two 
 how to stack these residuals tenfold 
 the liberal concept of what menll do 
 20 on 6 he didnt hear me 
 indigenous african only spoke zulu 
 my american tongue was leery 
 walked out the gas station 
 a homeless man with a semitan complexion 
 asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land 
 deep water powder blue skies that crack open 
 a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin 
 he begged and pleaded 
 asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it 
 told him beat it 
 contributin money just for his pipe—i couldnt see it 
 he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated 
 listen to me i want a single bill from you 
 nothin less nothin more 
 i told him i aint have it and closed my door 
 tell me how much a dollar cost 
 
 
 its more to feed your mind 
 water sun and love the one you love 
 all you need the air you breathe 
 
 
 hes starin at me in disbelief 
 my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key 
 hes starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave 
 and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see 
 the reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 like i was supposed to save him 
 like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor 
 hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser 
 hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious 
 cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect 
 if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck 
 i never understood someone beggin for goods 
 askin for handouts takin it if they could 
 and this particular person just had it down pat 
 starin at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 have you ever opened up exodus 14 
 a humble man is all that we ever need 
 tell me how much a dollar cost 
 
 
 its more to feed your mind 
 water sun and love the one you love 
 all you need the air you breathe 
 
 
 guilt trippin and feelin resentment 
 i never met a transient that demanded attention 
 they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin 
 sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different 
 i should distance myself i should keep it relentless 
 my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin 
 so ima tell you like i told the last bum 
 crumbs and pennies i need all of mines 
 and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time 
 i got better judgment i know when niggas hustlin keep in mind 
 when i was strugglin i did compromise now i comprehend 
 i smell grandpas old medicine reekin from your skin 
 moonshine and gin nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin 
 im imaginin denzel but lookin at oneal 
 kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre 
 the jig is up i seen you from a mile away losin focus 
 and im insensitive and i lack empathy 
 he looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet 
 i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep 
 he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free 
 youre lookin at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power 
 the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit 
 the nerve of nazareth and ill tell you just how much a dollar cost 
 the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss—i am god 
 
 
 i washed my hands i said my grace 
 what more do you want from me 
 tears of a clown guess im not all what its all meant to be 
 shades of grey will never change if i condone 
 turn this page help me change to right my wrongs",how much a dollar really cost the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall gotta see how i’m chillin once i park this luxury car hopping out feeling big as mutombo 20 on pump 6 dirty marcellus called me dumbo 20 years ago cant forget now i can lend him a ear or two how to stack these residuals tenfold the liberal concept of what menll do 20 on 6 he didnt hear me indigenous african only spoke zulu my american tongue was leery walked out the gas station a homeless man with a semitan complexion asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land deep water powder blue skies that crack open a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin he begged and pleaded asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it told him beat it contributin money just for his pipe—i couldnt see it he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated listen to me i want a single bill from you nothin less nothin more i told him i aint have it and closed my door tell me how much a dollar cost its more to feed your mind water sun and love the one you love all you need the air you breathe hes starin at me in disbelief my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key hes starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see the reason why he was mad at a stranger like i was supposed to save him like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck i never understood someone beggin for goods askin for handouts takin it if they could and this particular person just had it down pat starin at me for the longest until he finally asked have you ever opened up exodus 14 a humble man is all that we ever need tell me how much a dollar cost its more to feed your mind water sun and love the one you love all you need the air you breathe guilt trippin and feelin resentment i never met a transient that demanded attention they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different i should distance myself i should keep it relentless my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin so ima tell you like i told the last bum crumbs and pennies i need all of mines and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time i got better judgment i know when niggas hustlin keep in mind when i was strugglin i did compromise now i comprehend i smell grandpas old medicine reekin from your skin moonshine and gin nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin im imaginin denzel but lookin at oneal kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre the jig is up i seen you from a mile away losin focus and im insensitive and i lack empathy he looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free youre lookin at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit the nerve of nazareth and ill tell you just how much a dollar cost the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss—i am god i washed my hands i said my grace what more do you want from me tears of a clown guess im not all what its all meant to be shades of grey will never change if i condone turn this page help me change to right my wrongs,-0.9,3.5,0.987947954797163,0.9825635166920121,0.9898559992602676,0.5499053499958904,0.7430151236442951,0.22020775506923115,0.18583493524443107,0.9932146386284046,0.6843063170069443,0.8297587177063191

 been feeling this way since i was 16 came to my senses 
 you never liked us anyway fuck your friendship i meant it 
 im africanamerican im african 
 im black as the moon heritage of a small village 
 pardon my residence 
 came from the bottom of mankind 
 my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide 
 you hate me dont you 
 you hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture 
 youre fuckin evil 
 i want you to recognize that im a proud monkey 
 you vandalize my perception but cant take style from me 
 and this is more than confession 
 i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 im caught in my feelings i know that you feel it 
 you sabotage my community makin a killin 
 you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

 i said they treat me like a slave cah me black 
 woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black 
 and man a say they put me inna chains cah we black

 how you no see the whip left scars pon me back 
 but now we have a big whip parked pon the block 
 all them say we doomed from the start cah we black

 im the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean 
 i mean its evident that im irrelevant to society 
 thats what youre telling me penitentiary would only hire me 
 curse me till im dead 
 church me with your fake prophesizing that ima be just another slave in my head 
 institutionalized manipulation and lies 
 reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 you hate me dont you 
 i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt 
 watchin me as i pull up fill up my tank then peel out 
 muscle cars like pull ups show you what these big wheels bout ah

 katzkins on my radar bitch how can i help you 
 how can i tell you im making a killin

 thats as blunt as it gets i know you hate me dont you 
 you hate my people i can tell cause its threats when i see you 
 i can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 know i can tell because youre in love with that desert eagle 
 thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
 its funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war 
 two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door 
 beefin with pirus only death settle the score 
 so dont matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers 
 or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers 
 or try to celebrate february like its my bday 
 or eat watermelon chicken and koolaid on weekdays 
 or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements 
 or watch bet cause urban support is important 
 so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street 
 when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me

 like who got your best interest 
 like how much are you dependent 
 how clutch are the people that say they love you 
 and who pretending 
 how tough is your skin when they turn you in 
 do you show forgiveness 
 what brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended 
 what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing 
 what kind of bridge did they burn 
 revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned

 the ghost of mandela hope my flows stay propelling 
 let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
 as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga 
 
 
 i remember you was conflicted 
 misusing your influence 
 sometimes i did the same 
 abusing my power full of resentment 
 resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 i didn’t wanna self destruct 
 the evils of lucy was all around me 
 so i went running for answers 
 until i came home 
 but that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned 
 or maybe how a1 my foundation was 
 but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city 
 i was entering a new one 
 a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned 
 the word was respect 
 just because you wore a different gang color than mines 
 doesn’t mean i can’t respect you as a black man 
 forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 but i don’t know i’m no mortal man 
 maybe i’m just another nigga” 
 
 shit and that’s all i wrote 
 i was gonna call it another nigga but it ain’t really a poem 
 i just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to 
 other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you 
 i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa 
 about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground 
 what you mean by that what the ground represent 
 
 the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil 
 right 
 that’s how i see it my word is bond 
 i see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people 
 right 
 the poor people is gonna open up this whole world 
 and swallow up the rich people 
 cause the rich people gonna be so fat 
 and they gonna be so appetizing you know what i’m saying wealthy appetizing 
 the poor gonna be so poor and hungry 
 right 
 you know what i’m saying it’s gonna be like 
 you know what im saying its gonna be 
 there might there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu 
 they might eat the rich you know what im saying 
 
 aight so let me ask you this then 
 do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich 
 or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities 
 
 i see myself as a natural born hustler 
 a true hustler in every sense of the word 
 i took nothin’ i took the opportunities 
 i worked at the most menial and degrading job 
 and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it 
 i went from having somebody managing me 
 to me hiring the person that works my management company 
 i changed everything i realized my destiny 
 in a matter of five years you know what i’m saying 
 i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people 
 now it’s time to make millions for myself you know what i’m saying 
 i made millions for the record companies 
 i made millions for these movie companies 
 now i make millions for for us 
 
 and through your different avenues of success 
 how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity 
 
 by my faith in god by my faith in the game 
 and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true 
 right 
 you know what i’m saying 
 and it was happening to me for a reason 
 you know what i’m saying i was noticing shit 
 i was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 so it’s no problem you know 
 i mean it’s a problem but i’m not finna let them know 
 i’m finna go straight through 
 
 would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that 
 somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall 
 
 shit i like to think that at every opportunity i’ve ever been uh threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance 
 and not only me but it goes down my family tree 
 you know what i’m saying it’s in my veins to fight back 
 
 aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like 
 we fighting a war i’m fighting a war i can’t win 
 and i wanna lay it all down 
 
 in this country a black man only have like 
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength 
 and that’s right now while you a teenager while you still strong 
 while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back 
 cause once you turn 30 it’s like 
 they take the heart and soul out of a man 
 out of a black man in this country 
 and you don’t wanna fight no more 
 and if you don’t believe me you can look around 
 you don’t see no loud mouth 30year old motherfuckers 
 
 that’s crazy because me being one of your offsprings 
 of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that 
 there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so i wanted to ask you 
 what you think is the future for me and my generation today 
 
 i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores 
 and next time its a riot its gonna be like uh bloodshed 
 for real i don’t think america know that 
 i think america think we was just playing 
 and it’s gonna be some more playing but 
 it ain’t gonna be no playing 
 it’s gonna be murder you know what i’m saying 
 it’s gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this motherfucker 
 you know what i’m saying it’s gonna happen 
 
 that’s crazy man in my opinion 
 only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations 
 lot a people don’t understand how important it is you know 
 sometimes i can like get behind a mic 
 and i don’t know what type of energy i’ma push out 
 or where it comes from trip me out sometimes 
 
 because its spirits we ain’t even really rappin’ 
 we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 
 damn 
 
 i wanted to read one last thing to you 
 it’s actually something a good friend had wrote 
 describing my world it says 
 “the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 its only job is to eat or consume everything around it 
 in order to protect itself from this mad city 
 while consuming its environment 
 the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him 
 but praises the butterfly 
 the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness 
 and the beauty within the caterpillar 
 but having a harsh outlook on life 
 the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak 
 and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 already surrounded by this mad city 
 the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon 
 which institutionalizes him 
 he can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 he’s trapped 
 when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as 
 going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 the result 
 wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations 
 that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle 
 although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different 
 they are one and the same 
 what’s your perspective on that

 and you ask lift up your shirt because you wonder if a tattoo

 i know the truth is you wont love me until im gone 
 and even then the thing that comes after is movin on 
 i cant even capture the feeling i had at first 
 meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works 
 the people i look up to are goin from bad to worse 
 their actions out of character even when they rehearse 
 workin in the land of the free the home of the brave 
 i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place 
 breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved 
 and they dont like that its written all on they face 
 i dont know how ima make it out of here clean

 iconic duos rip and split at the seams

 missin out on my years 
 theres times when i wish i was where i was 
 back when i used to wish i was here 
 missin out on my days 
 scrollin through life and fishin for praise 
 opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways 
 i try and see whos there on the other end of the shade 
 most times its just somebody thats underaged 
 thats probably just alone and afraid 
 and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain 
 i always hear people complain about the place that they live 
 that all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give 
 cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit 
 that makes another city seem more excitin than it is 
 i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome 
 then she finally got to rome 
 and all she did was post pictures for people at home 
 cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known 
 i know another girl thats cryin out for help 
 but her latest caption is leave me alone 
 i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone 
 i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown 
 to post later and make it look like she still on the go 
 look at the way we live 
 i wasnt hidin my kid from the world 
 i was hidin the world from my kid 
 from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate 
 until you starin at your seed you can never relate 
 breakin news in my life i dont run to the blogs 
 the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call 
 they always ask why let the story run if its false 
 you know a wise man once said nothin at all 
 im exhausted and drained i cant even pretend 
 all these people takin miles when you give em an inch 
 all these followers but who gon follow me to the end 
 i guess ill make it to the end and ima find out then

 only lyin i do is lyin out in the tropics 
 only cryin i do is cryin from laughin bout it 
 only lackin i can do is my lack of responses 
 only rest that i do is where the rest of my commas 
 still i rise maya angelou vibes 
 when life comin at you from all angles and sides 
 and they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside 
 it really boils down to how you plan to survive 
 love certain ones but never get attached to em 
 give em nice things but whats that to em 
 especially when another girl i flew in is flickin up in my bathroom 
 and they recognize the bathroom 
 all hell starts to break loose in my texts 
 i only tell lies to who i gotta protect 
 i would rather have you remember me how we met 
 i would rather lose my leg than lose their respect 
 but thatll never happen the way im watchin my step 
 that aint what im bout 
 im in control of my destiny never in doubt 
 if i cant make it with you ill make it without

 sweeter the berry the blacker the juice 
 the boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth 
 too many lyrics bout houses and loot 
 too many walt disney characters mouses and goofs 
 i mean you know i love a challenge but challenged by who 
 ill let you bring a thousand recruits 
 my peers are a talented group 
 but even if you take all their statistics and carry the two 
 even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops 
 theres still nothin they could really do 
 its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due 
 whenever its time to recoup 
 yeah soon as this album drop im out of the deal 
 in the house playin dangelo how does it feel 
 i got a fear of havin things on my mind when i die 
 what you got time on your hands or time on your side 
 is there any sense in doin these songs when im high 
 is there more to life than goin on trips to dubai 
 yachts on the 4th of july g5 soarin the skies 
 is there more to life than all of these corporate ties 
 and all of these fortunate times 
 and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size 
 am i missin somethin thats more important to find 
 like healin my soul like family time 
 is there more to life than just when im feelin alive 
 is there more

 too late for condolences when its over with

 be open with people i need some closure with 
 be honest with myself and take ownership 
 opinions started to burn when tables started to turn

 unforgivin times but fuck it i manage 
 why is my struggle different than others 
 only child that’s takin care of his mother 
 as health worsens and bills double 
 that’s not respectable all of a sudden 
 i don’t get a pat on the back for the come up 
 what do you see when you see me 
 when did all the things i mean 
 from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning 
 maybe i share it with too many people 
 back then it used to just feel like our secret 
 back when i would write and not think about how they receive it 
 i be tryna manifest the things i needed 
 and look now i mean its hard to believe it even for me 
 but youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all 
 how they go from not wantin me at all 
 to wantin to see me lose it all 
 things get dark but my aura just starts glowin 
 im overcome with emotions 
 ones i cant access when im stoned sober 
 jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra 
 i could only speak what i know of 
 man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin 
 and icy heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin 
 and puttin your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin 
 all you did was write the book on garbageass rollies 
 ego strokin picture postin 
 claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only 
 but you just had to show me 
 see i know cause i study you closely 
 i know when someone lyin 
 i notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired 
 i know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet 
 sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didnt lose you

 i was an angry yute when i was writin’ views 
 saw a side of myself that i just never knew 
 i’ll probably selfdestruct if i ever lose but i never do 
 steady doin double shifts 
 1da doin’ the beat and i open up like a double click 
 more blessings because im generous 
 thirtyseater plane for like ten of us 
 remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet 
 she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it 
 nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it 
 cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it 
 scary whenever i close my eyes at night 
 wakin’ up to public statements about my private life 
 i can never sleep til mornin on all my quiet nights 
 but you can rest assured that my mind is right 
 get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days 
 never stick around to see shit change 
 get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin 
 seasons go by like im bingewatchin 
 went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv 
 to not even showin up at a club less we doin biz 
 i cant even party while a nigga pursuin this 
 distractions will do you in in the truest sense 
 especially people that want to lecture me 
 and frame it like they just want the best for me

 weston road flows i did this shit for my nigga renny 
 back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies 
 feel like we go back a century run in the store for centuries 
 then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it 
 he was wavy doin mixtapes out of your basement 
 he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment 
 then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission 
 we probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him 
 feel like i never say much but man theres a lot to know 
 feel like the difference between us really startin to show 
 im lookin at they first week numbers like what are those 
 i mean you boys not even coming close 
 i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration 
 you number one and im eddie murphy we tradin places 
 look in the mirror im closer than i really appear 
 creepin like chilli without the tender love and care 
 no tender love and care no love and affection 
 i got a price on my head but theres a risk in collecting 
 i might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson 
 feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together 
 yeah but here we are and its a new semester 
 40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure 
 a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin 
 a lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation 
 your best day is my worst day i get green like earth day 
 you treat me like im born yesterday you forgot my birthday 
 you dont be scorin perfect 
 you dont be workin like how we be workin 
 you platinum like wrappers 
 on hersheys boy that shit is worthless 
 you get the message over and over like it was urgent 
 and then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person 
 the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in 
 and did it with a purpose 
 used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships 
 nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension 
 a lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned 
 shout out to kd we relate we get the same attention 
 its rainin money oklahoma city thunder 
 the most successful rapper 35 and under 
 im assumin everybodys 35 and under 
 thats when i plan to retire man its already funded 
 yeah i brought your wifey out to saint martin 
 she violated i sent her back where it all started 
 how quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment 
 leave it to niggas like you to show em light in the darkness 
 told my momma that i found a lady in the east 
 cancun when i got signed they upgraded the suite 
 don julio in the freezer that they gave us for free 
 i get you all you can eat just have some patience with me 
 you wouldnt tell me you loved me started seein monique 
 last time i heard from monique tminus was makin beats 
 i used to hit the corner store to get to tahiti treat

 a lot of pent up aggression comin out of my section 
 ovo on me while yall niggas was playin dressup 
 and i know who gon take the fall with me 
 they right here on call with me they all with me 
 you could throw curve balls but i got the glove fitted 
 theyve been sayin its love but it isnt love is it 
 toast to the days when they wasnt out to get me 
 i worked at jaydees connections whenever jason let me 
 ceesay’s i was buyin fitteds everyday 
 kiddies caribana tryin not to catch a stray 
 i dropped out right before i graduate 
 six credits left my mama had her saddest day 
 “its only up from here i promise you just gotta wait” 
 and she took my word for it thats all i had to say 
 lately i just feel so out of character 
 the paranoia can start to turn into arrogance 
 thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist 
 i get a blank page when i try to draw a comparison 
 im gettin straight to the point with it 
 need yall to know that i never needed none of yall niggas 
 fuck bein all buddy buddy with the opposition 
 its like the front of the plane nigga its all business 
 but i havent flown with yall boys in a minute 
 
 
 look theyd rather run up on me than towards their goals 
 my niggas still hit the club when its 20 below 
 who you think runnin this show 
 you saw it in me at 20 years old 
 the lingo start to sound like we talkin in code 
 i got a pure soul i dont do the hate 
 you dont worry bout fittin in when you custom made 
 me and niko used to plot on how to make a change 
 now me and kobe doin shots the night before the game 
 still drop 40 with liquor in my system 
 numbers goin unlisted just to create some distance 
 i might see you on and off but ill never switch ya 
 niggas quick to double cross like both of us christian 
 lamborghini got me feelin like im christian bale 
 and i never bend my morals for the ticket sales 
 tippin scales bars heavy like triple xl 
 i never tag no one in id rather get you myself 
 runnin through the 6 thumbin through the contracts 
 im possessed you can see it under the contacts 
 they think i had the silver spoon but theyll get it soon 
 i still got somethin left to prove since you left me room 
 payment plan for the family debt we in the minus 
 and like its goin in a trunk i put it all behind us 
 where you tryna go i got it ill take us wherever 
 im a staple in the game all my papers together 
 and my life is on display like truman 
 they wanna pree the movements gotta start to make em sooner 
 my exes made some of my favorite music 
 i dated women from my favorite movies 
 karmas such a thing of beauty 
 id share more of my story but you wouldnt believe it

 oh you gotta love it oh you got—oh you gotta love it 
 i heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it 
 i told 1da send me something and i got it covered 
 somehow i always rise above it 
 why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover 
 the game is all mine and im mighty possessive 
 lil wayne could not have found him a better successor 
 every shot you see em take at me they all contested 
 allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question 
 last night i went to sleep wanting more 
 tryna decide what direction i should go towards 
 some nights i wish i could go back in life 
 not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice 
 28 at midnight wonder whats next for me 
 longevity wonder how long theyll check for me 
 prolly forever if i stay in my zone 
 i speak on this generation but cant change it alone 
 i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe 
 thats quite a platform you chose you shouldve kept it inside 
 oh you tried its so childish calling my name on the world stage 
 you need to act your age and not your girls age 
 it gets worse by the annual 
 my careers like a howto manual so i guess its understandable man 
 oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah 
 i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em 
 to show they outfits off guess they need the attention 
 i remember when it used to be music that did it 
 but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin 
 im managed by my friends that i grew up with 
 id rather give that 15 to people i fuck with 
 if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin 
 wed prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on 
 but here we are yeah 
 lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence 
 they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments 
 bitches alter my messages like we had words 
 and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve 
 bitter women im overtextin are pmsing 
 crazy this year—fuckin with my image 
 ive been tryna reach the youth so i can save em this year 
 fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year 
 and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 
 bout how we need protection from those protectin the block 
 nobody lookin out for nobody 
 maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody 
 instead of bein somebody that makes the news so everybody can tweet about it 
 and then they start to rip about it 
 and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it 
 damn i just had to say my piece about it 
 oh you gotta love it— 
 but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public thats a hotter subject 
 i been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget 
 i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins 
 shout out to ashley tasha bianca 
 julia ericka southern america 
 part of my heritage pardon my arrogance 
 part in my hair again thats that comeback flow 
 comeback flow once i start its apparent 
 im with girl who ass is so big thats partly embarrassin 
 but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement 
 your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you 
 shit is gettin so personal in your verses too 
 i wanna prove that im number one over all these niggas 
 bein number two is just being the first to lose 
 my city dictated music nobody seein us 
 winter here already but somehow im heatin up 
 been observin the game and felt like ive seen enough 
 lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see wassup 
 yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all 
 you rappin like the throne should be the three of yall 
 best i ever had seems like a decade ago 
 decadent flow and i still got a decade to go 
 oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace 
 why you rappin like you come from the streets 
 i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees 
 and im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves 
 phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease 
 i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese 
 special order for anybody thats comin for me 
 shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze 
 you see they got me back talkin like its just 40 oli and me 
 cuttin all loose ends i be the barber for free 
 im almost at four minutes goin off on the beat 
 feel like im in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats 
 man oh you gotta love it yeah 
 and on top of that its getting harder to eat 
 rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease 
 to think labels said theyd have a problem marketing me 
 and now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe 
 but man oh you gotta love it oh

 im livin like im out here on my last adventure 
 past the present when you have to mention 
 this is nothin for the radio but theyll still play it though 
 cause its that new drizzy drake thats just the way it go 
 heavy airplay all day with no chorus 
 we keep it thorough nigga rap like this for all of my borough niggas 
 i reached the point where dont shit matter to me nigga 
 i reached heights that dwight howard couldnt reach nigga 
 prince akeem they throw flowers at my feet nigga 
 i could go a hour on this beat nigga 
 im just as famous as my mentor 
 but thats still the boss dont get sent for 
 get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for 
 cause you dont really wanna hear me vent more 
 hot temper scary outcome 
 heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one 
 that always let they mouth run 
 bench players talkin like starters i hate it 
 started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it 
 yeah tom ford tuscan leather smellin like a brick 
 degenerates but even ellen love our shit 
 rich enough that i dont have to tell em that im rich 
 self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup 
 
 
 sittin gucci row like they say up at unlv 
 young rebel young money nothin you could tell me 
 paperwork takin too long maybe they dont understand me 
 ill compromise if i have to i gotta stay with the family 
 not even talkin to nicki communication is breakin 
 i dropped the ball on some personal shit i need to embrace it 
 im honest i make mistakes id be the second to admit it 
 think thats why i need her in my life to check me when im trippin 
 on a mission tryna shift the culture 
 tell me who dissin i got some things thatll hit the culprit 
 them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin 
 all of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments 
 fuck what you think im too busy thats why you leave a message 
 born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive 
 that shit i heard from you lately really relieved some pressure 
 like ayy b i got your cd you get an e for effort 
 i piece letters together and get to talkin reckless 
 owl chains like credentials you know you see the necklace 
 my lifes a completed checklist 
 im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now 
 just give it time well see whos still around a decade from now 
 thats real 
 
 
 how much time is this nigga spendin on the intro 
 lately ive been feelin like guy pearce in memento 
 i just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo 
 the family all that matters im just out here with my kinfolk 
 off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow 
 this for shorty up on glengrove who love when i catch my tempo 
 i sip the pora and listen to cappadonna talk to em 
 the fresh prince just had dinner with tatyana no lie 
 all these 90s fantasies on my mind 
 the difference is that with mine they all come true in due time 
 i might come through without security to check if youre fine 
 thats just me on my solo like fuck it like yolo 
 wanted to tell you accept yourself 
 you dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself 
 and if you end up needin some extra help then i could help 
 you know back on your feet and shit 
 tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit 
 how much time is this nigga spendin on the intro 
 how this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though 
 life is soundin crazy 40 on martin scorsese

 you shouldnt have to deal with that 
 id never make you feel like that cause 
 
 
 i love me i love me enough for the both of us 
 thats why you trust me 
 i know you been through more than most of us 
 so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of 
 darling you you give but you cannot take love 
 
 
 yeah i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive 
 passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance 
 i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping 
 i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different 
 started realizing a couple places i could take it 
 i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement 
 i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation 
 and influence a generation thats lacking in patience 
 ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience 
 just me and my old man getting back to basics 
 weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted 
 when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing 
 well fuck it we had a couple coronas 
 we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us 
 we even talked about you and our couple of moments 
 he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups 
 you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone 
 looking like you came from the 70s on your own 
 my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is 
 who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone 
 you dont even know what you want from love anymore 
 i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored 
 but girl what qualities was i looking for before 
 who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh 
 
 
 i love me i love me enough for the both of us 
 thats why you trust me 
 i know you been through more than most of us 
 so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of 
 darling you you give but you cannot take love 
 
 
 uh thinking bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures 
 or further back than that before i had the houston leverage 
 when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit 
 a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it 
 cause that night i played her three songs 
 then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on 
 then she start telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz 
 boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off 
 now its therapeutic blowing money in the galleria 
 or beverly center macys where i discovered bria 
 landmarks of the muses that inspired the music 
 when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it 
 the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree 
 ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me 
 now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment 
 know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt 
 remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz 
 girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision 
 learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions 
 when you find out how im living i just hope im forgiven 
 it seem like you dont want this love anymore 
 im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore 
 but girl what qualities was i looking for before 
 who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh 
 
 
 i love me i love me enough for the both of us 
 thats why you trust me 
 i know you been through more than most of us

 im the only one thats putting shots up 
 and like a potluck you need to come with it 
 dont run from it like htown in the summertime i keep it 100 
 met a lot of girls in my times there word to paul wall not one fronted 
 i was birthed there in my first year man i know that place like i come from it 
 backstage at warehouse in 09 like is bun coming
