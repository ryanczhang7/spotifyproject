Eminem & 50 Cent),"Yeah, I was born a misfit 
 Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich 
 Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence 
 I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick 
 ""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"" 
 And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin' 
 My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list 
 Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted"" 
 My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with 
 Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted 
 My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick 
 I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business 
 And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em 
 20 years old is when I came in the game 
 And now it's eight years on and you remember the name 
 And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today 
 But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great 
 I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware 
 Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked 
 You know I want way more than I already got 
 Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club 
  
  
 You know it ain't my time to call it a day 
 I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid

 I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh) 
 From Taco Bell to TRL 
 I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until 
 As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict 
 Funny 'cause I had pop appeal 
 But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?) 
 And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?) 
 In my eyelids now (What?) 
 I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah) 
 Without a doubt, by any means 
 If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em 
 I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes 
 Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between 
 You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams 
 Not even when I'm on my deathbed 
 Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet 
 So why would I quit? 
 The thought that I would stop when I'm dead 
 Just popped in my head 
 I said it, then forgot what I said

 You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip 
 Man, you know just what I mean 
 Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it 
 Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it? 
 Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin' 
 It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em 
 She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit 
 Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money? 
 Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles 
 Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow 
 The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit 
 Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit 
 Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober 
 Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

 Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine 
 I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
 The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind 
 So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 And when the world's against me is when I really come alive 
 And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride 
 You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs 
 I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun 
 I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up 
 Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
 Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree 
 To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key 
 And you'll see 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more 
  
  
 Another one to take the sting away 
 I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
 Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
  
  
 I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong 
 I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell 
 Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
 And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun 
 Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run 
 I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become 
 Conversations with my father on the A14 
 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
 Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me 
 With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans 
 Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou' 
 I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud 
 And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
 The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now 
 Somehow 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more 
  
  
 Another one to take the sting away 
 Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
 Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
  
  
 Welcome to the new show 
 I guess you know I've been away 
 But where I'm heading, who knows? 
 But my heart will stay the same 
 Welcome to the new show 
 I guess you know I've been away 
 But where I'm heading, who knows?

 Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends

 You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat 
 Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

 And how your family is doing okay 
 Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
 Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

 I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans 
 Goes to the gym at least six times a week 
 Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet 
 And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats 
 He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached 
 Owns every single Ministry CD 
 Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means 
 But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me 
 But still, I'm just keepin' it real 
 Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil' 
 I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back 
 'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at 
 Let me remind you of the days when 
 You used to hold my hand 
 And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans 
 I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman 
 Just a young boy tryin' to be loved 
 So let me give it to ya

 Your new man rents a house in the 'burb 
 And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse 
 Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas 
 Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous 
 He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime 
 And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign 
 Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"" 
 But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you 
 You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin' 
 Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin' 
 Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym 
 Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim 
 In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him 
 Okay, you need to be alone 
 And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone

 And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet

 Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance 
 Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance? 
 Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence 
 Oh well, she’s a local girl 
 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man 
 It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after 
 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese 
 And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need 
 I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley 
 She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi 
 Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat 
 B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly 
 She knows me well 
 Bit of a catch to have a local girl

 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free

 What's better than thinking about the ones you love? 
 Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love

 No one here to save the day now you're all alone

 I don't know about James bond 
 But round here nobody lives twice 
 When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye 
 Cause only a judge can give you life 
 This is my advice 
 Trust me, I nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after I got this ride 
 Pissed like I had way too much wine 
 Wished I didn't get one 
 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this 
  
  
 I never had a playlist in my heart 
 Now I need an A list just to chart 
 But I've been famous from the start 
 How am I gonna make my mark? 
  
  
 Are you gonna play me though?

 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there? 
 To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
 I am my music, my music is me 
 Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in 
  
  
 When the darkness creeps in 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 And when my dreams are sleeping 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 Watching me 
  
  
 You better wake up cause I A.M making moves 
 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 And when my dreams are sleeping

 Watching me 
  
  
 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one

 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me

 Glass on the side 
 I've been sat with you 
 For most of the night 
 Ignorin' everybody here 
 We wish they would disappear 
 So maybe we could get down now 
 And I don't wanna know 
 If you're gettin' ahead of the program 
 I want you to be mine, lady 
 To hold your body close 
 Take another step into the no-man's land 
 And for the longest time, lady 
  
  
 I need you darling 
 Come on, set the tone

 Won’t you let me know

 Come on, get involved

 This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage 
 And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days 
 Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know 
 But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke 
 Let it go until our roads are changed 
 Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave 
 No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say 
 But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray 
 I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you"" 
 Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila 
 I already know if she's a keeper 
 Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in 
 Deep shit if anybody finds out 
 I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now 
 Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch 
 One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth 
  
  
 I need you darling

 All the guys in here don't even wanna dance 
 Can you feel it? 
 All that I can hear is music from the back 
 But can you feel it? 
 Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'? 
 Before the beat kicks in again 
 Can you feel it?

 And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell 
 Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer 
 Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder? 
 Under the covers where we used to lay 
 And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played 
 I'd be on tour almost every day 
 When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay 
 Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed 
 Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe 
 We used each other's air just for the people to see 
 And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 We go anywhere, our minds would take us 
 And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up 
 And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause 
 We can all be loved the way that God made us 
 And time's the only reason that we could break up 
 Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much 
 Distance is relative to the time that it takes 
 To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again 
  
  
 Oh Nina 
 You should go, Nina 
 Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now? 
 And I've been living on the road, Nina 
 But then again you should know, Nina 
 Cause that’s you and me both, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now, now? 
  
  
 And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie 
 With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 
 Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone 
 Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits 
 Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish 
 Back to the burrow with all the Celtics 
 I disappear, you call me selfish 
 I understand but I can’t help it 
 I put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back 
 Overlook the situation 
 Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
 And I'm not saying we should be taking a break 
 Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late 
 So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane 
 But in a day we'll have to say it again 
  
  
 Oh Nina 
 You should go, Nina

 But you can't make it on your own 
 Sing that song, go

 But you can't mend your broken heart 
 Take it back, go 
 Oh won't you leave me now?

 Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine 
 Disappearing all night 
 I don’t wanna know where he's been lying 
 I know what I wanna do 
 Wanna runaway, runaway with you 
 Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go 
  
  
 How long you leaving? 
 Well, Dad just don’t expect me back this evening 
 Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this 
 It’s been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but 
  
  
 I love him from my skin to my bones 
 But I don’t wanna live in his home 
 There’s nothing to say cause he knows

 I’ve never seen my dad cry 
 Cold as stone in the kitchen light 
 I'll tell you it's about time 
 But I was raised to keep quiet 
 This is what I’m gonna do 
 Gonna runaway, gonna make that move 
 Gonna grab clothes and when it’s morning, go

 Gonna take my things and go 
 If things change in a matter of days 
 I could be persuaded to hold on 
 Mama was the same 
 None of us are saints I guess that God knows that 
 I don’t wanna runaway 
 And one of these days I might just show that 
 Put my home in a suitcase 
 Tie both shoe laces, and hope that

 Just wish you'd never gone for the man 
 And waited two weeks at least 
 Before you let him take you 
 I stayed true, I kind of knew 
 You liked the dude from private school 
 He's waiting for the time to move 
 I knew he had his eyes on you 
 He's not the right guy for you 
 Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth 
 No, I would never lie to you 
 But it was never fine to lose you 
 And what a way to find out 
 It never came from my mouth 
 You never changed your mind 
 But you were just afraid to mind out 
 But  it 
 I won't be changing the subject, I love it 
 I'll make your little secret public 
 It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons 
 You sleep with in your closet to get back at me 
 Trapped and I'm lacking sleep 
 Fact is you're mad at me 
 Because I backtrack so casually 
 You're practically my family 
 If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be 
 But tragically our love just lost the will to live 
 But would I kill to give it one more shot? 
 I think not 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no 
 Anymore 
  
  
 Recently I tend to zone out 
 Up in my headphones to Holocene 
 You promised your body but I'm away so much 
 I stay more celibate than in a monastery 
 I'm not cut out for life on the road 
 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much 
 And at the time we'd just go, so sue me 
 I guess I'm not the man that you need 
 Ever since you went to uni 
 I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
 Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad 
 But when I broke the industry 
 That's when I broke your heart 
 I was supposed to chart and celebrate 
 But good things are over fast 
 I know it's hard to deal with and see this 
 I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
 Then I turn the music off 
 And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus 
 I never really want to believe this 
 Got advice from my dad and he 
 Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need 
 I guess I'm unaware of it 
 Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no 
 Anymore 
  
  
 And since you left, I've given up my days off 
 It's what I need to stay strong 
 I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 
 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 
 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could 
 The irony is if my career in music didn't exist 
 In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid 
 I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink 
 And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's 
 Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill 
 And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill 
 Go down in history as just a wasted talent 
 Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ? 
 It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me 
 Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be 
 Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this 
 These things happen for a reason and you can't change  
 Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty 
 But I had to get this off my chest

 I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know 
 You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in 
 I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden 
 Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision 
 Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism 
 Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen 
 Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven 
 And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager 
 I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather 
 I'll do my own thing now and get respect after 
 And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter 
 For four years I never had a place to stay 
 But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight 
 At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home 
 I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked 
 And went from sleeping at a subway station 
 To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population 
 Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax 
 Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 I take it back with the rhythm and blues 
 With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news 
 Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school 
 I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop 
 Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes 
 I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth 
 And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit 
 They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot 
 But then again that's what they're supposed to do 
 And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on"" 
 I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong 
 But then I've never had an enemy except the NME 
 But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be 
 With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
 Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree 
 Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids 
 I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic 
 I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it 
 This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 
 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless 
 And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed 
 Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus 
 Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton 
 Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless 
 Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 
 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written 
 Now absence can make your heart ache 
 But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state 
 Vividly, need to let my liver be 
 And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends 
 It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me 
 And I hope to see him blowing up globally 
 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally 
 It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but 
 But I just write schemes 
 I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans 
 Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely 
 You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates 
 Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made 
 And every single second knowing that we'll never betray 
 The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down 
 That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme 
 Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? 
 With this you must know that the numbers just sold 
 Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me 
 We forget 90 percent of it when we wake 
 But the other 10 percent, it never fades 
 Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads 
 Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade 
 Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more 
 A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought 
 You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors 
 Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour 
 Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit 
 You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick 
 I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss 
 And most of these other guys are kids that pose 
 His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is 
 Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it 
 Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower 
 You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow 
 Igh!","i'm not a rapper, i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old, yeah, i moved out of my home i was macy gray, i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination, i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax? i'll take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack, i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm, i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering, ""everything that happens is from now on"" i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect, and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart, covered the planet, i'll take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no, i'll take it back now  now, i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly, need to let my liver be and i'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be, i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be, but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid, discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down that's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no  my dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme till i deliver the hype, am i just living a lie?

 You make me scream, and then I made you cry

 Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do 
 And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet 
 'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon

 Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence

 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man 
 It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after 
 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese 
 And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need 
 I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley 
 She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi 
 Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat 
 B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly 
 She knows me well 
 Bit of a catch to have a local girl

 Fill it up with bubbles 
 'Cause maybe you're loveable 
 Maybe you're my snowflake 
 And your eyes turn from green to gray 
 And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place 
 And you should never cut your hair 
 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder 
  
  
 And you will never know 
 Just how beautiful you are to me 
 But maybe I'm just in love 
 When you wake me up 
  
  
 And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me 
 Could you make me a cup of tea 
 To open my eyes in the right way 
 And I know you love Shrek 
 'Cause we've watched it 12 times 
 And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too 
 And if your DVD breaks today 
 You should've got a VCR 
 Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say 
 I know I've always been shit at computer games 
 And your brother always beats me 
 And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV 
 And then you laugh at me 
 And be asking me 
 If I'm gonna be home next week 
 And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep 
 And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

 You always try and get me to stop 
 But you drink as much as me 
 And I get drunk a lot 
 So I’ll take you to the beach 
 And walk along the sand 
 And I'll make you a heart pendant 
 With a pebble held in my hand 
 And I'll carve it like this necklace 
 So the heart falls where your chest is 
 Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach 
 And it falls just where it needs to be 
 And rests peacefully 
 So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now 
 Against yours now 
 Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up","i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it 12 times and maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a blu-ray, true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost, i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so i’ll take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up"

Devlin),"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up 
  
  
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul","hmm, let me go to see my family please, father, let me go as my mother sleeps  i don't know about james bond but round here nobody lives twice when you're gone, you're gone, without no bye cause only a judge can give you life this is my advice trust me, i nearly lost my life 3 weeks after i got this ride pissed like i had way too much wine wished i didn't get one anyway, i was going to the macbeth booked for a set even though i didn't have a set one skream hit the decks, i was like check one put on a show, but it weren't my best one left it, dropped off blacks at his destination then i was off to the next one 20 minutes later i was on the m1 tired, but i kept on going fell asleep without even knowing no motion in my face no movement in my legs, but the car still kept going woke up, lorry, flash panic, break, skid, crash skidded more, bang, smash out cold, ribs cracked, ouch i was in so much pain crawled out of a mégane that now looked like a mini when i was still on the first lane baffled, didn't even know my name fainted, too much shock in my brain surrounded by paramedics and feds trying to get up but fainted again  see, i just want you to take a sec and hear me out don't think i'm happy cos i smile when you see me out i've had serious madnesses where i've nearly disappeared and i'm begging lord to save me and let me go  to see my family and keep it inside dry eyes, while my brother weeps save my soul please, father, let me go keep me safe, as my mother sleeps  eyes closed, they just wouldn't open i could hear voices and my phone ringing fighting for life, can't tell if i'm winning one of the worst situations i've been in i could hear all of the angels singing but when they stopped humming my brain turned on, started running still in pain, but it started numbing the stone cold comeback i made was stunning i still tried to do a few shows 'cos i didn't wanna tell them that i weren't coming but i was left with a permanent problem nobody knows about the pain that i'm in (sly) ever so cunning 6 weeks later, jogging and running i used the first aid kit like a drum set picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming trust me, when it comes to mistakes you can't afford to let one in never done tunes for a while the pipeline was blocked so i learned and done a bit of plumbing they say tomorrow never dies but they forgot to tell you, you can you can have a sicker clan than wu-tang but when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam you can try beg for another sometimes i'll be on my way to a show thinking ""i just wanna see my brother"" then do a u-turn, i'm gone, one up   to see my family and keep it inside dry eyes, while my brother weeps save my soul"

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this 
  
  
 I never had a playlist in my heart 
 Now I need an A list just to chart 
 But I've been famous from the start 
 How am I gonna make my mark? 
  
  
 Are you gonna play me though? 
 This song was never meant for the radio 
 (I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing 
 And I don't have time for a playlist) 
 How much will you pay me though 
 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there? 
 To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
 I am my music, my music is me 
 Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial 
 Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile 
 So won't you hear me out? 
 Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club 
 Maybe I could take time singing for the dub 
 So won't you hear me out?

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly 
 Angels to die","listen, little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, thursday you work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try and you remember that your punter went crazy last night you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for you'll make a trip to the whittington where they'll look at your jaw they'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure they'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door but young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  little lady, your mind you've made up your injuries you can't hide with make-up you need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just in case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb with any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip last year when your pimp just lost it he wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway cause all the heroin is making you age but you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram mother had to get you out the motherland to study that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand little does she know you're never coming back? she put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan he's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer fancy that, you came to london to get pimped by your uncle, damn  she's just under the upper hand goes mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly  an angel will die covered in white closed eyes and hoping for a better life this time, we'll fade out tonight straight down the line  little lady, you're trembling with fear your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer you're sitting facing the detective, oh dear the meddling nurse couldn't just leave it she's only gone and made it much worse calling police and she'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused you're causing scandal going mad in the ward now the cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you the same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""who you working for?"" he's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore you're having a conversation you could be murdered for you're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court it's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own you've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe you reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat and then a voice says, ""where you been bitch? i wanna know"" no prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness you open the front door, he boots you in there's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error he towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight at this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye and in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece and dumps her body in the boot of his mercs in the street little lady left this earth in the worst way all because she got a card on her 13th birthday  and we're all under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and we don't wanna go outside, tonight cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly angels to die"

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me 
  
  
 I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
 Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?

 You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be 
 You're not going to feel out of place anymore 
 You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be 
 You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time 
 You just let it go, and, and grow with it 
 And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that 
 Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way 
 It's just changing because that's what happens in life 
 You grow up, everyone moves on 
 You're just learning 
 You stay true to yourself

 Well, who am I? I'm almost 25 
 Can't remember half the time that I've been alive 
 'Cause half was in a cheap apartment 
 And half was on the Eastside (Eastside) 
 They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos 
 And God knows that they were right 
 Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you 
 Then put you on a feature on the B-Side 
 And who do you call when it's late at night? 
 When the headlines just don't paint the picture right 
 When you look at yourself on a screen and say 
 ""Oh my God, there's no way that's me"" 
 And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried 
 And I bought another house, and I never go outside 
 And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit 
 Well, she told me 
 She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die 
 'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied 
 And I remember the names of every single kid I've met 
 But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed 
 And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee 
 And hoped that my father would finally call me 
 And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours 
 And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower 
 Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder 
 But then I realize that I'm no higher power 
 That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now 
 And I'm so happy I figured that out
