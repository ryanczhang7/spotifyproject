 king of my city king of my country king of my homeland 
 king of the filthy king of the fallen we livin again 
 king of the shooters looters boosters and ghettos poppin 
 king of the past present future my ancestors watchin 
 king of the culture king of the soldiers king of the bloodshed 
 king of the wisdom king of the ocean king of the respect 
 king of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it 
 king of the winners district and geniuses with conviction 
 king of the fighters king of the fathers king of the belated 
 king of the answer king of the problem king of the forsaken 
 king of the empathy you resent me king of remorse 
 king of my enemies may they fall defeat i rejoice 
 king of the skyscrapers dodgin haters broke religion 
 nine faces go against em i erased em with precision 
 i embrace them with collision kings did it 
 kings vision black panther king kendrick all hail the king 
 i dropped a million tears 
 i know several responsibilities put me here 
 i dont pedal backwards but i live oldfashioned 
 the lens that im lookin through 
 wont prescribe me the right glasses masses are now free 
 ashes im dumpin out bout to spread all cross seas 
 sisters and brothers in unison not because of me 
 because we dont glue with the opposition we glue with peace 
 but stilld fuck up your organization if any beef 
 what do you stand for 
 are you a activist what are your city plans for 
 are you a accident are you just in the way 
 your native tongue contradictin what your body language say

Kendrick Lamar,DAMN. COLLECTORS EDITION.,DUCKWORTH.,1,hiphop,"it was always me versus the world 
 until i found its me versus me 
 why why why why 
 why why why why 
 just remember what happens on earth stays on earth 
 we gon put it in reverse darling i told you many times 
 and i am telling you once again 
 just to remind you sweetheart that my oh lamar hail mary and marijuana times is hard 
 pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark 
 fellowship with demons and relatives im a star 
 life is one funny mothafucka 
 a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him 
 i might be buggin infomercials and no sleep 
 introverted by my thoughts 
 children listen it gets deep 
 see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects 
 the object was to process and digest povertys dialect 
 adaptation inevitable gun violence crack spot 
 federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals 
 anthony was the oldest of seven 
 well respected calm and collected 
 laughin and joking made life easier 
 hard times momma on crack 
 a fouryearold telling his nanny he needed her 
 his family history pimpin and bangin 
 he was meant to be dangerous 
 clocked him a grip and start slangin 
 fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces 
 even got some head from a smoker last weekend 
 dodged a policeman workin for his big homie 
 small time hustler graduated to a brick on him 
 ten thousand dollars out of a project housing 
 thats on the daily seen his first mil twenty years old 
 had a couple of babies had a couple of shooters 
 caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun 
 they assumin but witnesses couldnt prove it 
 that was back when he turned his back 
 and they killed his cousin 
 he beat the case and went back to hustlin 
 bird shufflin anthony rang 
 the first in the projects with the twotone mustang 
 that 50 thing they say 50 came 
 circlin parking lots and parking spots 
 and hoppin out while harassing the corner blocks 
 crooked cops told anthony he should kick it 
 he brushed them off and walked back 
 to the kentucky fried chicken 
 see at this chicken spot 
 there was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot 
 with a curly top and a gap in his teeth 
 he worked the window his name was ducky 
 he came from the streets the robert taylor homes 
 southside projects chiraq the terror dome 
 drove to california with a woman on him and 500 dollars 
 they had a son hoping that hed see college 
 hustlin on the side with a nine to five to freak it 
 cadillac seville hed ride his son around on weekends 
 threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket 
 cross the street from the projects 
 anthony planned to rob it 
 stuck up the place before back in 84 
 thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war 
 so many relatives telling us selling us devilish works 
 killing us crime intelligent felonious 
 prevalent proposition with nines 
 ducky was well aware they robbed the manager 
 and shot a customer last year 
 he figured hed get on these niggas good sides 
 free chicken every time anthony posted in line 
 two extra biscuits anthony liked him and then let him slide 
 they didnt kill him in fact it look like 
 theyre the last to survive 
 pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives 
 one curse at a time reverse the manifest 
 and good karma and ill tell you why 
 you take two strangers 
 and put em in random predicaments 
 give em a soul so they can 
 make their own choices and live with it 
 twenty years later them same strangers 
 you make em meet again 
 inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits 
 then you start reminding bout that chicken incident 
 whoever thought the greatest rapper 
 would be from coincidence 
 because if anthony killed ducky

 what they see from me 
 would trickle down generations in time 
 what they hear from me

 cause my dna wont let me involve in the light of god 
 im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone 
 im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more 
 im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness 
 fear whatever it is both is distinctive

 within fourteen tracks carried out over wax 
 searchin for resolutions until somebody get back

Kendrick Lamar,To Pimp A Butterfly,These Walls,1,hiphop,"i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence 
 sometimes i did the same if these walls could talk 
 if these walls could talk 
 if these walls could talk 
 if these walls could talk 
 if these walls could talk 
 if these walls could talk 
 sex she just want to close her eyes and sway 
 with you with you with you 
 exercise her right to work it out 
 its true its true its true 
 shout out to the birthday girls say hey hey say hey hey 
 ah girl 
 everyone deserves a night to play play 
 and she plays only when you tell her no if these walls could talk 
 i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
 if these walls could talk 
 i love it when im in it i love it when im in it if these walls could talk theyd tell me to swim good 
 no boat i float better than he would 
 no life jacket im not the god of nazareth 
 but your flood can be misunderstood 
 walls telling me they full of pain resentment 
 need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 me im just a tenant 
 landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 these walls are vulnerable exclamation 
 interior pink color coordinated 
 i interrogated every nook and cranny 
 i mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me 
 these walls want to cry tears 
 these walls happier when im here 
 these walls never could hold up 
 every time i come around demolition might crush if these walls could talk 
 i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
 if these walls could talk 
 i love it when im in it i love it when im in it if these walls could talk theyd tell me to go deep 
 yelling at me continuously i can see 
 your defense mechanism is my decision 
 knock these walls down thats my religion 
 walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 i suffocate then catch my second wind 
 i resonate in these walls 
 i dont know how long i can wait in these walls 
 ive been on the streets too long 
 looking at you from the outside in 
 they sing the same old song 
 about how they walls always the cleanest 
 i beg to differ i mustve missed them 
 im not involved id rather diss them 
 id rather call on you put your wall up 
 cause when i come around demolition gon crush 
 if these walls could talk 
 i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you 
 if these walls could talk 
 i love it when im in it i love it when im in it if your walls could talk theyd tell you its too late 
 your destiny accepted your fate 
 burn accessories and stash them where they are 
 take the recipe the bible and god 
 wall telling you that commissary is low 
 race wars happening no calling co 
 no calling your mother to save you 
 homies to say youre reputable not acceptable 
 your behavior is sammy da bull like 
 a killer that turned snitch 
 walls is telling me you a bitch 
 you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 that sentence so important 
 walls telling you to listen to sing about me 
 retaliation is strong you even dream bout me 
 killed my homeboy and god spared your life 
 dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 so when you play this song rewind the first verse 
 about me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 about me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 about me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 about her baby daddy currently serving life 
 and how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 and how she fucking on a famous rapper 
 walls could talk i remember you was conflicted 
 misusing your influence 
 sometimes i did the same

 the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact

 remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards 
 visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction

 spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion 
 winnin in every decision

 a homeless man with a semitan complexion 
 asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land 
 deep water powder blue skies that crack open 
 a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin 
 he begged and pleaded 
 asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it 
 told him beat it 
 contributin money just for his pipe i couldnt see it 
 he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated 
 listen to me i want a single bill from you 
 nothin less nothin more

 and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see 
 the reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 like i was supposed to save him 
 like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor 
 hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser 
 hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious 
 cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect 
 if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck 
 i never understood someone beggin for goods 
 askin for handouts takin it if they could 
 and this particular person just had it down pat

 let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
 as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga i remember you was conflicted 
 misusing your influence 
 sometimes i did the same 
 abusing my power full of resentment 
 resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 i didnt wanna self destruct 
 the evils of lucy was all around me 
 so i went running for answers 
 until i came home 
 but that didnt stop survivors guilt 
 going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned 
 or maybe how a1 my foundation was 
 but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one 
 a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned 
 the word was respect 
 just because you wore a different gang color than mines 
 doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man 
 forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga shit and thats all i wrote 
 i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground represent the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right thats how i see it my word is bond i seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetising the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what im saying its gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for us and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all down in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30year old muthafuckas thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka you know what im saying its gonna happen thats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy imma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city 
 while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly 
 the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar 
 but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
 he can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 hes trapped 
 when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 the result 
 wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle 
 although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same whats your perspective on that

saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all down in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30year old muthafuckas thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka you know what im saying its gonna happen thats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy imma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts hes trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same whats your perspective on that pac pac

Kendrick Lamar,"good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe)","Sing About Me, I'm Dying Of Thirst",1,hiphop,"when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me i woke up this morning and figured id call you 
 in case im not here tomorrow im hoping that i can borrow 
 a peace of mind im behind on whats really important 
 my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life 
 im fortunate you believe in a dream 
 this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine 
 and last night was just another distraction or a reaction 
 of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened 
 you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help 
 held him like a newborn baby and made him feel 
 like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up 
 but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will 
 as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive 
 everybodys a victim in my eyes 
 when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black 
 a demon glued to my back whispering get em 
 i got em and i aint give a fuck 
 that same mentality that told my brother not to duck 
 in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors 
 i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover 
 the life that i knew as a youngn in pajamas and duntaduns 
 when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs 
 dumb niggas like me never prosper 
 prognosis of a problem child im proud and well devoted 
 this piru shit been in me forever 
 so forever imma push it wherever whenever 
 and i love you cause you love my brother like you did 
 just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big 
 and if i die before your album drop i hope gunshots promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 you wrote a song about my sister on your tape 
 and called it section80 the message resembled brendas got a baby 
 whats crazy was i was hearing about it 
 but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit 
 judging her past and shit well its completely my future 
 her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit 
 and imma need that forty dollars even if i gotta 
 fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot 
 gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three 
 my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys 
 matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es 
 he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week 
 this is the life of another girl damaged by the system 
 these foster homes i run away and never do miss em 
 see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back 
 to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim 
 of a family gene that show women how to be woman 
 or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin 
 then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught 
 three niggas in one room first time i was tossed 
 and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit 
 my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain 
 if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait 
 your rebuttal a little too late 
 and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song 
 cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own 
 and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great 
 a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight 
 ill probably live longer than you and never fade away 
 ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate 
 and im on the grind for this cake imma get it or die trying 
 im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying 
 you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help em 
 with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga 
 dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga 
 when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself 
 am i really scared of passing away if its today i hope i hear a 
 cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon 
 with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus 
 i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline 
 reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance 
 with the other side may come soon and if im doomed 
 may the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons 
 i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror 
 get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots 
 and im not sure why im infatuated with death 
 my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats 
 that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful 
 and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch 
 maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death 
 really stuck in the schema of wondering when imma rest 
 and youre right your brother was a brother to me 
 and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me 
 in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen 
 by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between 
 her personal life i was like it need to be told 
 cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul 
 exactly whatd happen if i aint continued rappin 
 or steady being distracted by money drugs and four 
 fives i count lives all on these songs 
 look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong 
 fighting for your rights even when youre wrong 
 and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone 
 am i worth it 
 did i put enough work in 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 i said when the lights shut off 
 and its my turn to settle down 
 my main concern 
 promise that you will sing about me 
 promise that you will sing about me promise that youll sing about me forever 
 promise that youll sing about me forooooh 
 promise that youll sing about me forever 
 promise that youll sing about me forooooh 
 promise that youll sing about me forever

J. Cole,4 Your Eyez Only,4 Your Eyez Only,1,hiphop,"yeah 
 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes only 
 for your eyes for your eyes only hey 
 niggas be dying on the daily 
 it seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly 
 cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal 
 control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal 
 cause young niggas is hard headed they letting off 
 full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause 
 aint no coming back family dressed in black 
 plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack 
 and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet 
 like i aint out in the field like that 
 i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back 
 despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless 
 screaming fuck the law my life is lawless 
 thats what you call it 
 aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven 
 this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic 
 i try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless 
 but these felonies be making life the hardest 
 resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet 
 or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it 
 thats why i write this sonnet 
 if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break 
 play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it 
 let her know my life is on it 
 for your eyes 
 let her know my life is on 
 for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me youre probably grown now so this songll hit you 
 if youre hearing this it means unfortunately im no longer with you 
 in the physical not even sure if i believe in god 
 but because you still alive 
 he got me praying that the spiritual is real 
 so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too 
 so i know how part of you feels 
 maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me 
 life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me 
 i hope not im tired of dope spots 
 and fiends that smoke rocks 
 ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot 
 im writing this cause me and the devil had a dance 
 i see death round the corner apologizing in advance 
 dont know if i ever had a chance 
 at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia 
 but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once 
 innocence disappeared by the age of eight years 
 my pops shot up drug related 
 mama addicted 
 so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging 
 blood was staining the concrete 
 older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet 
 that slow money picked up the family business 
 by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence 
 round the same time you came in this world 
 me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl 
 i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of 
 for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen 
 i was nineteen it took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me 
 and now its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that were never set for me 
 im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps catching up to me 
 and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me 
 for your eyes do you understand 
 for your eyes do you understand me in several ways i couldve went out too many to count 
 was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
 was it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out 
 niggas dont know how to act in a drought 
 see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed 
 my views misshaped by new mixtapes 
 that confirmed the shit i learned from in the streets was true 
 that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you 
 they just pull up on your street let the heat have you 
 and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food 
 i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops 
 ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you 
 i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views 
 much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you 
 into a box where your son dont even know his pops 
 and the cyclical nature of doing time continues 
 my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news 
 i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon 
 and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true 
 but maybe theres a chance that its not 
 and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels 
 and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes 
 i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you 
 for your eyes only for your eyes 
 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes 
 for your eyes only 
 for your eyes do you understand one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling 
 what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling 
 i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing 
 but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling 
 he said jermaine i knew since we was children i never asked for nothing 
 when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me 
 i dealt with the repercussions of my actions 
 i know you tried to steer me away from that shit 
 but that shit was in my blood you know my life 
 i know your momma nigga send my love 
 in case i never get a chance to speak again 
 i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib 
 thats the way i wished my family lived 
 but my granny crib was in the jects 
 i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at 
 he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions 
 but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side 
 i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed 
 with that said im proud to say i was a father 
 write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready 
 so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch it disrespect it 
 this perspective is a real one another lost ville son 
 i dedicate these words to you and all the other children 
 affected by all the mass incarceration in this nation 
 that sent your pops to prison when he needed education 
 sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better 
 although that means i would never be brought into this world cos my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with 
 little zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told 
 girl your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was cold 
 not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old 
 not becuase he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues 
 not cause he went from bagging up them grams to serving os 
 now your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was hard 
 not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars 
 not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true 
 your daddy was a real nigga cos he loved you 
 for your eyes only",yeah for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only hey niggas be dying on the daily it seems my dreams faded for far too

 carolinas finest you knew that already 
 and turned to the greatest i proved that already 
 and if you would like i do it twice 
 i just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways 
 this for my niggas that was tossin the graves 
 every so often i fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days 
 we used to play before your coffin was made 
 just got the call nigga got caught with a stray 
 hope hes okay 
 just got paid what cochran got paid to free oj 
 just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers 
 who know a nigga far too well and thats the danger 
 know me better than i know myself 
 i rip a page out my notebook in anger 
 and let these thoughts linger singing dont give em too much you 
 dont let em take control 
 its one thing you do 
 dont let em taint your soul 
 if you believe in god 
 one things for sure 
 if you aint aim too high 
 then you aim too low whats the price for a black man life 
 i check the toe tag not one zero in sight 
 i turn the tv on not one hero in sight 
 unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics 
 look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights cameras and action 
 may no man alive come through and damage my faction 
 i brought you niggas with me cause i love you like my brothers 
 and your mothers like my mother 
 think we need a plan of action 
 the bigger we get the more likely egos collide 
 its just physics please lets put our egos aside 
 you my niggas and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies 
 i hope that we remember these 
 nights fulla hennessey 
 when hov around we switch up to that dusse 
 gotta show respect one day we tryna stay where you stay 
 cause we from where you from 
 not talkin bout the slums 
 im talkin bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb 
 keep a black nigga dyin by a black nigga gun 
 and keep on listening to the frontin ass rap niggas son 
 yeah i said son 
 this is new yorks finest 
 for 11 winters straight i took on new yorks climate 
 like show me new yorks ladder 
 i climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get obama to force the air force to find it 
 never mind it youll never reach that 
 cole is the hypnotist control the game whenever he snap 
 thats every track i aint serve no pies i aint slang no dope 
 i dont bring no lies niggas sang my quotes 
 i dont play no games boy i aint no joke 
 like the great rakim when i make my notes 
 you niggas might be l or you might be kane 
 or you might be slick rick with 19 chains 
 or you might be drizzy drake or kendrick lamar

 look at my eyes and see a future but dont sugar code it but dont sugar code 
 it 
 listen history repeats itself and thats just how it goes 
 same with that these rappers always bite each others flows 
 same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock n roll 
 justin timberlake eminem and then macklemore 
 while silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown 
 look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound 
 this year ill probably go to the awards dapper down 
 watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile 
 im just playin 
 but all good jokes contain true shit 
 same rope you climb up on they hang you with 
 but not jeremaine my aim too sick 
 i bang nigga i came to bring the pain my brain too quick 
 you see how i maneuver this game i aint stupid 
 i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid 
 and break the chain and change minds 
 one verse at a time and claim too sick 
 and fuck it if the shoe 
 who is the king 
 we all kings we all kings nigga 
 kings of ourselves first and foremost true 
 while people debate whos the king of this rap game 
 here comes lil o jeremaine 
 with every ounce of strenght in his veins 
 to snatch the crown from who ever yall think has it 
 but than rather to place it on his head as soon as he grabs it 
 poof boom poaw its like magic 
 with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates 
 and falls to the earth from which it came 
 its done 
 aint gonna be no more kings 
 be wary of any man that claims 
 because deep down he clings onto the need for power 
 but in reality hes a coward 
 ultimately hes scared to die 
 and sometimes so am i 
 but when in tune with the most high 
 i realize that fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side 
 today i know we are the same 
 are the same you and i 
 different kind of skin different set of eyes 
 two different minds but only one god its only one god nigga 
 its all for the kings

J. Cole,Born Sinner,Let Nas Down,1,hiphop,"freedom or jail clips inserted 
 a babys bein born same time a man is murdered 
 the beginning and end so far as rap goes 
 its only natural i explain my plateau 
 and also what defines my name yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin no id my mentor now let the story begin i used to print out nas raps and tape em up on my wall 
 my niggas thought they was words but it was pictures i saw 
 and since i wanted to draw i used to read em in awe 
 then he dropped stillmatic rocked the cleanest velour 
 fast forward who thought that i would meet him on tour 
 im earnin stripes now nigga got adidas galore 
 backstage i shis hand let him know that hes the man 
 when he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand 
 no time to soak up the moment though cause i was in a jam 
 hov askin wheres the record that the radio could play 
 and i was strikin out for months 9th inning feeling fear 
 jeter under pressure made the biggest hit of my career 
 but at first that wasnt clear niggas had no idea 
 dion called me when it dropped sounded sad but sincere told me nas heard your single and he hate that shit 
 said you the one yo why you make that shit 
 i cant believe i let nas down damn my heart sunk to my stomach i cant believe i let nas down 
 i got defensive on the phone resentment was in my tone fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin 
 no id my mentor now let the story begin 
 i couldnt help but think that maybe i had made a mistake 
 i mean you made you owe me dog i thought that you could relate 
 but while i shot up the charts you mean tellin me 
 that i was not up to par when i followed my heart 
 granted my heart was tainted by my mind i kept on sayin 
 wheres the hits you aint got none 
 you know jay would never put your album out without none 
 and dog you know how come 
 labels are archaic formulaic with their outcomes 
 they dont know they just study the charts 
 me i study the shows the fans study their hearts 
 i had a feelin i was killin and this music we were spillin out would change lives forever fuck the label put it out friday night lights blew that was classic number 2 
 now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin true 
 still no release date from the label are they insane 
 gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way i let nas down i got no one to blame im ashamed i let nas down but this is gods plan you could never understand fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals 
 pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible 
 now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin 
 no id my mentor now let the story begin 
 i always believed in the bigger picture 
 if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core then i can open a door 
 reintroduce em to honesty show em that they need more 
 the difference between the pretenders and the kendrick lamars 
 and so i took the fall like the son of the lord 
 on the cross dyin for that fake shit you niggas bought 
 for the past decade if i should pass please let this be my last essay 
 therefore i write from the heart 
 apologies to ogs for sacrificin my art 
 but im here for a greater purpose i knew right from the start 
 im just a man of the people not above but equal 
 and for the greater good i walk amongst the evil 
 dont cry mama this the life i choose myself 
 just pray along the way that i dont lose myself 
 this is for the nigga that said that hiphop was dead 
 i went to hell to resurrect it how could you fail to respect it 
 lettin nas down i got the phone call quietly i mourned dog i let nas down 
 yeah and on this flight may i never lose sight fuck it 
 yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals

Drake,So Far Gone,Say What's Real,1,hiphop,"why do i feel so alone 
 like everybody passing through the studio is in character 
 as if he acting out a movie role 
 talking bullshit as if it was for you to know 
 and i dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go 
 so they stick around kicking out feedback 
 and i entertain it is if i need that 
 i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that 
 my privacy about the only thing i need back 
 but its hard thinkin in polite flows 
 when stephano polato suits are your night clothes 
 and jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes 
 and you still make it even when they say your flight close 
 eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows 
 life was so full now the shit just been lypod 
 always said ill say it all on the right track 
 but in this game you only lose when you fight back 
 black diamond bracelets showing you the basics 
 i cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this 
 i make hits and like a bitch thats married i aint miss 
 24 hours from greatness im that close 
 dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt 
 transitioning from fitting in to standing out 
 los angeles cabanas or atlanta south 
 watch hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out 
 and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out 
 so i park about 5 houses down 
 she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown 
 but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around 
 so she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus 
 and yet i role around the fucking city like ya highness 
 got niggaz reacting without a sinus 
 cause what im working with is timeless 
 and promoters trying to get me out to they club 
 and say i have fun but i cant imagine how 
 cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fucking right now 
 and shit can get weird unless they all down 
 and so i stay clear we from a small town 
 and everybody talks and everybody listen 
 and somehow the truth just always comes up missing 
 ive always been something that these labels cant buy 
 especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul 
 and silvia be telling taz damn drake fly 
 and he just be like silly motherfucker i know 
 that was your bad how can you pass up on em 
 he just take them records and he gas up on em 
 wayne would probably put a million cash up on em 
 surprised no one ever put your ass up on em 
 oh they did po at least they tried to 
 and thats what happen when you spitting what inside you 
 but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video 
 and they think they can market you however they decide to 
 nah before they told me to do me 
 and dont listen to anybody that knew me 
 cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me 
 and if you think i changed in the slightest could have fooled me 
 boy and to my city im the two three 
 drug dealers live vicariously through me 
 i quit school and its not because im lazy 
 im just not the social type and campus life is crazy 
 understand i could get money with my eyes closed 
 lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo 
 so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll 
 sell that motherfucker to any rapper that i know 
 cause they need it much more than i ever will 
 i got new shit im getting better still 
 little niggaz put my name in they verses 
 cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal 
 future said cause its ye shit you better kill 
 and i think this got that making of a legend feel 
 problem with these other niggaz they aint never real 
 yea its all i can say",why do i feel so alone like everybody passing through the studio is in character as if he acting out a movie role talking bullshit as if it was for you to know and i dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go so they stick around kicking out feedback and i entertain it is if i need that i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that my privacy about the only thing i need back but its hard thinkin in polite flows when stephano polato suits are your night clothes and jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes and you still make it even when they say your flight close eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows life was so full now the shit just been lypod always said ill say it all on the right track but in this game you only lose when you fight back black diamond bracelets showing you the basics i cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this i make hits and like a bitch thats married i aint miss 24 hours from greatness im that close dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt transitioning from fitting in to standing out los angeles cabanas or atlanta south watch hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out so i park about 5 houses down she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around so she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus and yet i role around the fucking city like ya highness got niggaz reacting without a sinus cause what im working with is timeless and promoters trying to get me out to they club and say i have fun but i cant imagine how cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fucking right now and shit can get weird unless they all down and so i stay clear we from a small town and everybody talks and everybody listen and somehow the truth just always comes up missing ive always been something that these labels cant buy especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul and silvia be telling taz damn drake fly and he just be like silly motherfucker i know that was your bad how can you pass up on em he just take them records and he gas up on em wayne would probably put a million cash up on em surprised no one ever put your ass up on em oh they did po at least they tried to and thats what happen when you spitting what inside you but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video and they think they can market you however they decide to nah before they told me to do me and dont listen to anybody that knew me cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me and if you think i changed in the slightest could have fooled me boy and to my city im the two three drug dealers live vicariously through me i quit school and its not because im lazy im just not the social type and campus life is crazy understand i could get money with my eyes closed lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll sell that motherfucker to any rapper that i know cause they need it much more than i ever will i got new shit im getting better still little niggaz put my name in they verses cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal future said cause its ye shit you better kill and i think this got that making of a legend feel problem with these other niggaz they aint never real yea its all i can say,-1.0,2.5,0.8942211586153752,0.48030917160245,0.8885118796160303,0.6872487756901191,0.5277468105252455,0.14722544060488152,0.16281837884699307,0.30596091408454906,0.47506881882232666,0.7415559548418336

Drake,So Far Gone,Brand New,1,hiphop,"this here is on some truthful shit 
 it seems like everything i do your used to it

 so then i gotta hide what im feeling inside

 i highly doubt this feeling is reversible 
 knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know 
 that you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside 
 so i dont ever question you and damn 
 i cant even find the perfect brush 
 so i can paint whats going through my mind 
 racing against myself but im a couple steps behind 
 this why i gotta ask is anything im doing brand new

 that makes another city seem more excitin than it is

 then she finally got to rome 
 and all she did was post pictures for people at home 
 cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known 
 i know another girl thats cryin out for help 
 but her latest caption is leave me alone 
 i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone 
 i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown 
 to post later and make it look like she still on the go

Drake,Scorpion,Is There More,1,hiphop,"only holdin up i do is my end of the bargain 
 only beggin that i do is me beggin your pardon 
 only tryin that i do is me tryin the hardest 
 only problems i do are math problems with profit 
 only lyin i do is lyin out in the tropics 
 only cryin i do is cryin from laughin bout it 
 only lackin i can do is my lack of responses 
 only rest that i do is where the rest of my commas 
 still i rise maya angelou vibes 
 when life comin at you from all angles and sides 
 and they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside 
 it really boils down to how you plan to survive 
 love certain ones but never get attached to em 
 give em nice things but whats that to em 
 especially when another girl i flew in is flickin up in my bathroom 
 and they recognize the bathroom 
 all hell starts to break loose in my texts 
 i only tell lies to who i gotta protect 
 i would rather have you remember me how we met 
 i would rather lose my leg than lose their respect 
 but thatll never happen the way im watchin my step 
 that aint what im bout 
 im in control of my destiny never in doubt 
 if i cant make it with you ill make it without 
 they say take the good with the bad ill take it without 
 houston women i wineanddine and take to the house

 ill let you bring a thousand recruits 
 my peers are a talented group 
 but even if you take all their statistics and carry the two 
 even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops 
 theres still nothin they could really do 
 its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due 
 whenever its time to recoup 
 yeah soon as this album drop im out of the deal 
 in the house playin dangelo how does it feel 
 i got a fear of havin things on my mind when i die 
 what you got time on your hands or time on your side 
 is there any sense in doin these songs when im high 
 is there more to life than goin on trips to dubai 
 yachts on the 4th of july g5 soarin the skies 
 is there more to life than all of these corporate ties 
 and all of these fortunate times 
 and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size 
 am i missin somethin thats more important to find 
 like healin my soul like family time 
 is there more to life than just when im feelin alive 
 is there more passion instant 
 sweat beads feel me feel me 
 cupids shot me 
 my heartbeats racing my heartbeats racing 
 tempt me drive me tempt me

 used to be in lunchroom playin dominoes 
 i dont want to have to go to funerals 
 i gotta start sleepin at the studio 
 i dont have no time to be no romeo 
 all the love i need is at the rodeo 
 all the love i need is here at ovo yeah 
 all the girls i know are there with ian throw 
 who knows where i end up when that shit gets old 
 maybe it never gets old and thats just how it goes 
 last table left in carbone callin plays on a rotary phone 
 i take a glass it dont mean nah dont go with me home 
 might move our annual shit to the dome 
 i need 40000 people to see what im on 
 yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves 
 i was an angry youth when i was writin views 
 saw a side of myself that i just never knew 
 ill probably selfdestruct if i ever lose but i never do 
 steady doin double shifts 
 1da doin the beat and i open up like a double click 
 more blessings because im generous 
 thirtyseater plane for like ten of us 
 remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet 
 she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it 
 nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it 
 cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it 
 scary whenever i close my eyes at night 
 wakin up to public statements about my private life 
 i can never sleep til morning on all my quiet nights 
 but you can rest assure that my mind is right 
 get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days 
 never stick around to see shit change 
 get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin 
 seasons go by like im bingewatchin 
 went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv 
 to not even showin up to a club less we doin bis 
 i cant even party while a nigga pursuin this 
 distractions will do you in in the truest sense 
 especially people that want to lecture me and frame it like they just want the best for me 
 or they check for me whatever splits it up 
 so theres more for them and theres less for me 
 they dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me 
 no ones done it successfully 
 7am in germany cant believe that they heard of me 
 last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery 
 always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me 
 thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency 
 last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally 
 take this shit to heart its always executed perfectly 
 if we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me 
 you overnight celebrity you one day star 
 swear i told you that im in this bitch for eternity 
 i am a reflection of all of your insecurities 
 behind closed doors a lot of 6 god worshipping 
 done talk now cause theres other shit thats concernin me 
 theres real ones around me 
 i want to make sure they learn from me 
 i want to see my dog but his grandmothers his surety 
 he cant even dip out to see me in an emergency 
 my life is set around competition and currency 
 takin summer off cause they tell me i need recovery 
 maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me

 and of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine you sit and you pray hoping that the stars align 
 my luck is a sure thing cause im living right 
 when i needed you you couldnt give me any advice 
 but you always had something to say every other time 
 everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way 
 im fooding and serving them all like im working for minimum wage 
 someone up there must just love testing my patience 
 someone up there must be in need of some entertainment 
 forgiveness for your ways 
 if i ever loved ya ill always love ya thats how i was raised 
 same way im right here still feeling the wave 
 same way im realizing on a day to day all of my lets just be friends are friends i dont have anymore 
 how do you not check on me when things go wrong 
 guess i shouldve tried to keep my family closer 
 much closer 
 all of my lets just be friends are friends i dont have anymore

 kennys caravan and trying not to catch a stray 
 i dropped out right before i graduate 
 six credits left my mama had a saddest day 
 its only up from here i promise you just gotta wait 
 and she took my word for it thats all i had to say

 the paranoia can start to turn into arrogance 
 thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist 
 i get a blank page when i try to draw a comparison 
 im getting straight to the point with it 
 need yall to know that i never needed none of yall niggas 
 fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition 
 its like a front of the plane nigga its all business 
 but i havent flown with yall boys in a minute look theyd rather run up on me than towards them goals 
 my niggas still hit the club when its 20 below 
 who you think running this show

 and i dont wanna see you end up with nothing 
 yall throw the word family around too much in discussion

 now you the one getting buckets 
 they put their arm around you now you becoming the crutches 
 kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to 
 and women that you seen on tv look better in person 
 and either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes 
 from there 
 but these aint the girls from brampton this aint that local action 
 the haters just bringing me and my people closer actually 
 what happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen 
 are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened 
 we just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two 
 supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you 
 my plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf 
 and treat the money like secrets keep that shit to ourselves

Drake,If You're Reading This It's Too Late,6PM In New York,1,hiphop,"yeah oh you gotta love it 
 oh you got oh you gotta love it 
 i heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it 
 i told 1da send me something and i got it covered 
 somehow always rise above it 
 why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover 
 the game is all mine and im mighty possessive 
 lil wayne could not have found him a better successor 
 every shot you see them take at me they all contested 
 allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question 
 last night i went to sleep wanted more 
 tried to decide what direction i should go towards 
 some nights i wish i could go back in life 
 not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice 
 28 at midnight wonder whats next for me 
 longevity wonder how long theyll check for me 
 prolly forever if i stay in my zone 
 i speak on this generation but cant change it alone 
 i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe 
 quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside 
 oh you tried its so childish calling my name on the world stage 
 you need to act your age and not your girls age 
 it gets worse by the annual my careers like a how to manual 
 so i guess its understandable man 
 oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer 
 i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em 
 to show they outfits off guess they need the attention 
 i remember when it used to be music that did it 
 but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin 
 im managed by my friends that i grew up with 
 id rather give that 15 to people i fuck with 
 if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin 
 we prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on 
 but here we are yeah 
 lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence 
 they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments 
 bitches alter my message like we have words 
 and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve 
 bitter women im overtextin are pmsing crazy this year 
 fuckin with my image 
 ive been tryna reach to you so i can save em this year 
 fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year 
 and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 
 bout how we need protection from those protectin the block 
 nobody lookin out for nobody 
 maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody 
 instead of bein somebody that makes the news 
 so everybody can tweet about it 
 and then they start to rip about it 
 and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it 
 damn i just had to say my peace about it 
 oh you gotta love it 
 but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public 
 thats a hotter subject 
 ive been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget 
 i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins 
 shout out to ashley biama julia ericka southern america 
 part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again 
 thats that comeback flow comeback flow 
 once i start its apparent 
 i wanted a girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin 
 but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions 
 and fuck all the judgement 
 your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you

 i wanna prove that im number one over all these niggas 
 bein number two is just being the first to lose 
 my city dictated music nobody seein us

 decadent flow and i still got a decade to go 
 oh please take at ease wheres the love and the peace 
 why you rappin like you come from the streets 
 i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees 
 and im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves 
 phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease 
 i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese

Drake,Nothing Was The Same (Deluxe),From Time,1,hiphop,"whats up been a minute since we kicked it youve been caught up 
 with them bitches i dont get it youre a star love 
 you shouldnt have to deal with that 
 id never make you feel like that cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us 
 thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us 
 so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of darling you you give but you cannot take love i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive 
 passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance 
 i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping 
 i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different 
 started realizing a couple places i could take it 
 i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement 
 i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation 
 and influence a generation thats lacking in patience 
 ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience 
 just me and my old man getting back to basics 
 weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted 
 when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing 
 well fuck it we had a couple nas 
 we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us 
 we even talked about you and our couple of moments 
 he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups 
 you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone 
 looking like you came from the 70s on your own 
 my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is 
 who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone 
 you dont even know what you want from love anymore 
 i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored but girl what qualities was i looking for before 
 who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh thinking bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures 
 or further back than that before i had the houston leverage 
 when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit 
 a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it 
 cause that night i played her three songs 
 then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on 
 then she start telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz 
 boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off 
 now its therapeutic blowing money in the galleria 
 or beverly center macys where i discovered bria 
 landmarks of the muses that inspired the music 
 when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it 
 the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree 
 ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me 
 now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment 
 know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt 
 remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz 
 girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision 
 learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions 
 when you find out how im living i just hope im forgiven 
 it seem like you dont want this love anymore im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore 
 but girl what qualities was i looking for before 
 who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

 weigh all the options nothings off the table

 and i i love myself way more than i love you 
 the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest 
 mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm i think this is the part where im supposed to say something good 
 to compensate it so it doesnt come off bad 
 but sometimes i think really bad things 
 really really 
 really bad things and i love myself way more than i love you 
 see if i was trying to relate it to more people 
 id probably say im struggling with loving myself 
 because that seems like a common theme 
 but thats not the case here 
 i love myself way more than i love you 
 and i think about killing myself 
 so best believe i thought about killing you today

 i guess its hard to decipher all of the bills 
 especially when you got family members on payroll 
 the media said it was outlandish spendin 
 the media said hes way out of control 
 i just feel like im the only one not pretendin 
 im not out of control im just not in they control 
 i know im the most influential 
 that time cover was just confirmation 
 this generations closest thing to einstein 
 so dont worry about me im fine 
 i can see a thousand years from now in real life 
 skate on the paradigm and shift it when i feel like 
 troll conventional thought dont need to question 
 i know its antiquated so sometimes i get aggressive 
 thank god for jay electra he down with the mission 
 did it with with no permission on our own conditions 
 most blacks with money have been beaten to submission 
 yeezy with the big house did it way different 
 never listen to hollywood producers

 most black men couldnt balance a checkbook 
 but buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look 
 well it all looks great 
 four hundred years later we buyin our own chains 
 the light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard

 i am one with the people 
 i am one with the people real 
 ive been woken from enlightened mans dream

 learned to sing inside the lords house but stopped at the age of nine 
 i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride 
 the paving stones i played upon they kept me on the grind 
 so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 and when the worlds against me is when i really come alive 
 and everyday that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride 
 you know that ive got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs 
 i think life has got to the point i know without its no fun 
 i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up 
 instead i look in the mirror questioning what ive become 
 i guess its a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 without a ninetofive job or an uni degree 
 to be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 show me the locked doors i find another use for the key 
 and youll see im well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 but with that said give me one more higher 
 another one to take the sting away 
 i am happy on my own so here ill stay 
 save your lovin arms for a rainy day and ill find comfort in my pain eraser i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong 
 i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell 
 relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well 
 and aint nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 because youre living your dream man this shit should be fun 
 please know that im not trying to preach like im reverend run 
 i beg you dont be disappointed with the man ive become 
 our conversations with my father on the a14 
 age twelve telling me ive gotta chase those dreams 
 now im playing for the people dad and they know me 
 with my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans 
 wembley stadium crowds twohundredandfortythou 
 i may have grown up but i hope that damiens proud 
 and to the next generation inspirations allowed the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now 
 somehow im well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me

 another one to take the sting away

Ed Sheeran,Suncity,Castle on the Hill,0,pop,"when i was six years old i broke my leg 
 i was running from my brother and his friends 
 and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down 
 i was younger then take me back to when i found my heart and broke it here 
 made friends and lost them through the years 
 and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long 
 i know ive grown but i cant wait to go home im on my way 
 driving at 90 down those country lanes 
 singing to tiny dancer 
 and i miss the way you make me feel and its real 
 when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes 
 running from the law through the backfields and 
 getting drunk with my friends 
 had my first kiss on a friday night 
 i dont reckon that i did it right but i was younger then take me back to when 
 we found weekend jobs when we got paid 
 wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
 me and my friends have not thrown up in so long 
 oh how weve grown but i cant wait to go home im on my way 
 driving at 90 down those country lanes 
 singing to tiny dancer 
 and i miss the way you make me feel and its real 
 when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill 
 over the castle on the hill 
 over the castle on the hill one friend left to sell clothes 
 one works down by the coast 
 one had two kids but lives alone 
 ones brother overdosed 
 ones already on his second wife 
 ones just barely getting by but 
 these people raised me 
 and i cant wait to go home and im on my way 
 i still remember these old country lanes 
 when we did not know the answers 
 and i miss the way you make me feel and its real

Ed Sheeran,American Teen,Lately,0,pop,"i seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
 awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 jetlagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any 
 clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many 
 although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon 
 cause i heard that time waits for nobody i suppose its true 
 we make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables 
 to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme 
 so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 cause real will recognise real is what my father says 
 and ill be sticking to this phrase until i pass away 
 overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow but ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 5 oclock with lights off 
 interview with a vampire 
 sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require 
 i swear i said that ill sleep when im dead 
 whos on the beat upon the feature with ed its dev to the z 
 overtired palefaced like michael myers 
 bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage ive acquired 
 and over the time within this maze ill think youll find youll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 
 cause i got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take 4 seconds out the game 
 its time to wage war 
 scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 im haling from the essex and the east london boarder line 
 villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 be wide awake just like your snorting lines or get left mortified like youve just seen the ghost of jesus walking by 
 i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be the times im living in i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be 
 the times im living in lately i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 deliver the raps how i flow 
 i live with the raps now and those that hate me call me ron 
 but they wont slytherin too easy believe me im snape minded 
 be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that im in 
 its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows 
 some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with silocon 
 im still broke without the money for a mac pro living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow 
 opposite of sober cause i never did my homework 
 which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older 
 i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie 
 await death take deep breaths try to never die 
 never die 
 2 guys with the same view keep it tight like screws 
 making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes 
 and if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze 
 times elapsing while your catching zs the masses like to move 
 we scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 driven young gentlemen 
 ive hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months causei havent slept in them true 
 im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so im correcting em 
 we got the fans all like oh wow its devs and ed what less did you bloody expect from em 
 in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 fighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got 
 i keep my pupils engaged 
 like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake 
 i never sleep

 even though i didnt have a set one 
 skream hit the decks i was like check one 
 put on a show but it werent my best one

 then i was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later i was on the m1 
 tired 
 but i kept on going 
 fell asleep without even knowing 
 no motion in my face 
 no movement in my legs but the car still kept going 
 woke up 
 lorry 
 flash 
 panic 
 break 
 skid 
 crash 
 skidded 
 more 
 bang 
 smash 
 out 
 cold 
 ribs 
 cracked 
 ouch 
 i was in so much pain 
 crawled out of a megan that now looked like a mini 
 when i was still on the first lane 
 baffled didnt even know my name 
 fainted too much shock in my brain 
 surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 trying to get up but fainted again 
 i just want you to take a second hear me out 
 dont think im happy cuz i smile when you see me out 
 ive had serious madnesses where ive nearly disappeared 
 oh im begging lord to save me and let me go 
 to see my family 
 and keep it inside 
 dry eyes while my brother weeps 
 save my soul 
 please father let me go 
 keep me safe as my mother sleeps eyes closed they just wouldnt open 
 i can hear voices and my phone ringing 
 fighting for life cant tell if im winning 
 one of the worst situations ive been in 
 i can hear all of the angels singing but when it stopped humming 
 my brain turned on stared running 
 still in pain but it started numbing 
 the stone cold comeback i made was stunning 
 i still tried to do a few shows cuz i didnt wanna tell them that i werent coming 
 but i was left with a permanent problem 
 nobody knows about the pain that im in inside 
 ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later jogging and running 
 i used the first air kit like a drum set 
 picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming 
 trust me when it comes to mistakes 
 you cant afford to let one in 
 never done dream for a while 
 the black plan was blocked 
 so i learnt and done a bit of plumbing 
 they say tomorrow never dies 
 but he forgot to tell you you can 
 you can have a sicker clan than wutang 
 but when your times up thats it its you fam 
 you can try beg for another 
 sometimes ill be on my way to a show 
 thinking i just wanna see my brother 
 then do a uturn im gone runner i just want you to take a second hear me out

 little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday 
 its 30 degrees thursday 
 you work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes 
 lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night 
 you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 you drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry 
 forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 youll make a trip to the whittington were theyll look at your jaw 
 theyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 theyll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 but young woman

 in case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb 
 with any luck youll see the same dude who stiched your top lip 
 last year when your pimp just lost it 
 he wouldnt recognise if you stared him in the face anyway 
 cos all the heroin is making you age 
 but your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag

 mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 little does she know your never coming back 
 she put you in her brothers hand only for him to formulate another plan 
 hes the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer 
 fancy that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn ed sheeran shes just under the upper hand

 with closed eyes hoping for a better life 
 this time well fade out tonight

 your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear 
 your sitting facing the detective oh dear 
 the meddling nurse couldnt just leave it 
 shes only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 shell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused 
 your causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 the coppers trying to calm you telling you he wont let no one harm you 
 the same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for 
 hes talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore 
 your having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 its kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before 
 just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that its hard 
 he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 begs you to use it 
 hes useless if your gonna be stupid 
 cos an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips your on your own 
 youve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 you reach your door and then it dawns that youve been followed home 
 before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 and then a voice says where you been bitch i wanna know 
 no prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness 
 you open the front door he boots you in 
 theres something new in him hes silent now that fills you with terror 
 get your albibi straight you could be killed for an error 
 he towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 at this point your life flashes before your eyes 
 your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor 
 despite the mess theres only one thing thats caught his eye 
 and in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece 
 and dumps her body in the boot of his merc in the street

Ed Sheeran,American Teen,Goodbye to You,0,pop,"hey can you hear me 
 i just wanted to let you know hmm i hope you can hear what i write to you 
 how could i say goodbye to you 
 when im a life that came out of the inside of a life 
 that was inside of 
 you 
 i gotta respect the way you provided food for the 
 whole fam you 
 came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of 
 hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day rest in 
 life in you working but you were never stressed free 
 just locked in a cage slaving they said they were 
 gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to 
 amazement broke your heart but still you were prone 
 to last and your sorrow was over fast i hope your 
 listening right i still think of you every sunday no 
 one can top your chicken and rice even through the 
 darkness times you held us all up cause your vision was 
 bright i knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 you never let anyone see your heartache you just got 
 on with it anyone tells me that they knew you said 
 you were beautiful and your words you would stand 
 strong with it cause they were like warmth on a winter 
 night but i was just too young to go on with it and 
 there somethings i could try to do but its an 
 impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to 
 you i couldnt do that i owe my life to you 
 and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign i 
 hope this pain will heal in time you know i never want 
 to be alone ohh 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and 
 will you think of me up there can i say goodbye to 
 you and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace can i say 
 goodbye to you ohh 
 i think you phoney i was younger with the knowledge of 
 things that i know now i would be by your side when you 
 needed me instead of asking you nan can i go out 
 standing in a road with the gangs that i know now 
 everyones missing you loads jessicas grown up 
 warren lauren and alex are fine and imp living with 
 hope its been a while since ive seen c and the 
 mouths i miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing 
 with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time 
 goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have never been funny in my heart the only one that dissed 
 me was sonia she took all our inheritance money left 
 the rest of us to pick up the pieces i never forgive 
 the way she betrayed us there ent a big enough reason 
 before i sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing 
 but i guess that everyones different or should i say 
 no ones perfect she had happiness in front of her but 
 chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing since you 
 gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is 
 my next step i got all the bricks and the cement but 
 its hard when its done i dont know what to expect 
 so give me the strength that i need to perform this 
 task make it right i must do and i ask cause i trust 
 you it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you 
 and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign i 
 hope this pain will heal in time you know i never wanna 
 be aloneeeeee 
 i can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there can i say goodbye to 
 you and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace can i say 
 goodbye to you ohh 
 its just for now so i should hush ill never get 
 enough ill see you when i see you but i miss you ohh 
 how i miss you its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but i 
 miss you ohh how i miss you 
 there ent enough words to describe how sorry i am for 
 the pain that i caused sorry for when i stuck up my 
 own blood we were young he said i was rape and he broad 
 and for the day police came to the door im sorry for 
 being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and 
 making you mourn i never been able to say this 
 before cause ive was so inconsiderate you love me 
 unconditionally and i took advantage of it like a idiot 
 not seeing the pure soul that i was living with i 
 really hope that you can forgive me you going away 
 was a punishment but i wont let go im holding you 
 with me but i still fight the emotions within me

Ed Sheeran,No.6 Collaborations Project,Don't,0,pop,"la la la la i met this girl late last year 
 she said dont you worry if i disappear 
 i told her im not really looking for another mistake 
 i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait but then i jumped right in a week later returned 
 i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn 
 but i gave her my time for two or three nights 
 then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again 
 she told me i was never looking for a friend 
 maybe you could swing by my room around ten 
 baby bring the lemon a bottle of gin 
 well be in between the sheets till the late am 
 baby if you wanted me then you should have just said 
 shes singing

 dont with my love 
 that heart is so cold 
 all over my own 
 i dont wanna know that babe la la la dont with my love 
 i told her she knows 
 take aim reload 
 i dont wanna know that babe la la la for a couple of weeks i only want to see her 
 we drink away the days with a take away pizza 
 before a text message was the only way to reach her 
 now shes staying at my place loves the way i treat her singing out aretha all over the track like a feature 
 and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either 
 but me her we make money the same way 
 four cities two planes the same day and those shows have never been what its about 
 maybe well go together just figure it out 
 id rather put on a film with you sit on the couch 
 but we should get on the plane or well be missing it now wish id have written it down the way that things played out 
 when she was kissing him how i was confused about 
 she should figure it out why im sat here singing dont with my love

 dont with my love 
 i told her she knows 
 take aim reload 
 i dont wanna know that babe on my hotel door 
 i dont even know if she knows what for 
 she was crying on my shoulder i already told you 
 trust respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next 
 but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all 
 and i never saw him as a threat 
 until you disappeared with him to have sex of course its not like we were both on tour 
 we were staying on the same hotel floor 
 and i wasnt looking for a promise or commitment 
 but it was never just fun i thought you were different this is not the way you realize what you wanted 
 its a bit too much too late if im honest 
 and all this time god knows im singing dont with my love

Ed Sheeran,No.6 Collaborations Project,Nina,0,pop,"i met you when i was a teen 
 but then you were one as well 
 and i could play a guitar 
 just like ringing a bell 
 sometimes i wonder 
 in any other summer 
 could you be a part time lover to me 
 listening to stevie wonder 
 under the covers where we used to lay 
 and re stacks is what the speakers played 
 id be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed 
 getting high as two kites when we needed to breath 
 wed use each others air just for the people to see 
 and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 wed go anywhere our minds would take us 
 and id say you were beautiful without your make up 
 and you dont need even to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us 
 and times the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i was away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i aint ever coming home nina 
 oh wont you leave me now and ive been living on the road nina 
 but then again you should know nina cause thats you and me both nina 
 oh wont you leave me now and every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie 
 with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 taking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own 
 cause every day when i was away wed only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits 
 acting as if we was two rabbits 
 and then youd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics 
 id disappear youd call me selfish 
 i understand but i cant help i put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 but youll be in between forever so i guess well have to take a step back 
 overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and im not saying we should be taking a break 
 just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and its too late 
 so we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane 
 but in a day wed have to say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i aint ever coming home nina 
 oh wont you leave me now and ive been living on the road nina 
 but then again you should know nina 
 cause thats you and me both nina 
 oh wont you leave me now love will come and love will go 
 but you cant make it on your own sing that song 
 go oh wont you leave me now 
 people grow and fall apart 
 but you cant mend your broken heart 
 take it back 
 go oh wont you leave me now 
 ooh oh nina you should go nina 
 love will come and love will go but you cant make it on your own 
 cause i aint ever coming home nina 
 sing that song

Ed Sheeran,No.6 Collaborations Project,The Man,0,pop,"now i dont wanna hate you 
 just wish youd never gone for the man 
 and waited two weeks at least 
 before you let him take you 
 i stayed true 
 i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school 
 hes waiting for the time to move 
 i knew he had his eyes on you 
 hes not the right guy for you 
 dont hate me cause i write the truth 
 no i would never lie to you 
 but it was never fine to lose you 
 and what a way to find out 
 it never came from my mouth 
 you never changed your mind 
 but you were just afraid to find out 
 but fuck it 
 i wont be changing the subject i love it 
 ill make your little secret public its nothing 
 im just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet 
 to get back at me 
 trapped and im lacking sleep 
 fact is youre mad at me because i backtrack so casually 
 youre practically my family 
 if we married then ill guess youd have to be 
 but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot 
 i think not i dont love you baby i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no 
 anymore i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont wanna love you no 
 anymore recently i tend to zone out 
 up in my headphones to holocene 
 you promised your body but im away so much 
 i stay more celibate than in a monastery 
 im not cut out for life on the road 
 cause i didnt know id miss you this much 
 and at the time wed just go 
 so sue me 
 i guess im not the man that you need 
 ever since you went to uni 
 ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
 full of less cash and i guess that could get bad 
 but when i broke the industry 
 thats when i broke your heart 
 i was supposed to chart and celebrate 
 but good things are over fast 
 i know its hard to deal with and see this 
 i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
 then i turn the music off and all im left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus 
 i never really want to believe this 
 got advice from my dad 
 and he told me that family is all ill ever have and need i guess im unaware of it 
 success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with i dont love you baby i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no 
 anymore i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont wanna love you no 
 anymore and since you left 
 ive given up my days off 
 its what i need to stay strong 
 i know you have a day job 
 but mine is 247 
 i fell like writing a book 
 i guess i lied in the hook cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could 
 the irony is if my career and music didnt exist 
 in 6 years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid 
 im frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink 
 and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and its 
 just hiding my misguiding thoughts that im trying to kill 
 and id be writing my will before im 27 
 ill die from a thrill 
 go down in history as just a wasted talent 
 can i face the challenge 
 or did i make a mistake erasing its only therapy 
 my thoughts just get ahead of me 
 eventually ill be fine i know that it was never meant to be 
 either way i guess im not prepared but ill say this 
 these things happen for a reason and you cant change shit 
 take my apology 
 im sorry for the honesty 
 but i had to get this off my chest i dont love you baby 
 i dont need you baby 
 i dont want you no 
 anymore i dont love you baby

Ed Sheeran,No.6 Collaborations Project,Take It Back,0,pop,"im not a rapper im a singer with a flow 
 ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know 
 youll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in 
 i never want to get bitten 
 cause plagiarism is hidden 
 watch how i sit on the rhythm 
 prisoner with a vision 
 signed to a label 
 but didnt listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didnt 
 so perk your ears up and listen 
 studio is the system 
 and you could say that im driven 
 and now its onto the next saga 
 we drink the best lager 
 ill never try to win you over like your stepfather 
 i do my own thing now 
 and get respect after 
 and im avoiding the caine 
 like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay 
 but its safe to say that it kept me grounded 
 like a paper weight 
 at 16 years old yeah i moved out of my home 
 i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked 
 went from sleeping at a subway station 
 to sleeping with a movie star 
 and adding to the population 
 not my imagination 
 i dont wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now mmmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us 
 dont you fade into the back love no i take it back with the rhythm and blues 
 with my rap pack ill be singing the news 
 tryin act like jack black 
 when i bring it to school 
 i make a beat with my feet 
 by just hittin the loop 
 bringing the lyrics to prove 
 that i can fit in these shoes 
 i give you the truth through the vocal booth 
 and stars burst out on the scene 
 like an opal fruit 
 they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot 
 but then again thats what theyre supposed to do 
 and im supposed to be calm 
 i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 whispering everything that happens 
 is from now on ill be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 since they are claiming i handled it wrong 
 but then ive never had an enemy 
 except the nme but ill be selling 
 twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be 
 with only spectacles ahead of me 
 and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree 
 singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids 
 i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic 
 im battling for respect and i dont know if i have it this songs from the heart cover the planet 
 i take it back now mmmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us dont you fade into the back love 
 no 
 and take it back now now i dont ever wanna be perfect 
 cause im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless 
 and i accept the fact that someones got to win worst dressed 
 taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus 
 putting on a brave face like timothy dalton 
 considering a name change thinking it was hopeless 
 rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 
 cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written 
 now absence can make your heart ache 
 but drinking absinth can change your mind state 
 vividly need to let my liver be 
 and ill say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends 
 is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me 
 and i hope to see him blowing up globally 
 cause that how its supposed to be 
 im screaming out vocally 
 it might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams 
 but but i just write schemes im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be 
 but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that well never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down thats how we plan it out 
 its time to take it back now mmmm come on and take it back love 
 come on and take it back for us 
 dont you fade into the back love 
 no mmm come on and take it back love

 wishing i was sober 
 i know ill never hold you like i used to but a house gets cold when you cut the heating 
 without you to hold ill be freezing 
 cant rely on my heart to beat in

 take words out of my mouth just from breathing 
 replace with phrases like when you leaving me 
 should i should i maybe ill get drunk again 
 ill be drunk again 
 ill be drunk again 
 to feel a little love i wanna hold your heart in both hands 
 not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can 
 and ive got no plans for the weekend 
 so should we speak then 
 keep it between friends 
 though i know youll never love me like you used to there may be other people like us 
 who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up 
 flames just create us 
 burns dont heal like before 
 and you dont hold me anymore on cold days cold plays out like the bands name 
 i know i cant heal things with a handshake 
 you know i can change 
 as i began saying 
 you cut me wide open like landscape 
 open bottles of beer but never champagne 
 to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

 but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus 
 now im in position to be another stalker 
 like everything i say seems to always sound awkward like our last kiss it was perfect 
 but we were nervous on the surface 
 and im always saying everyday that it was worth it 
 pain is only relevent if it still hurts 
 i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative 
 and go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss so am i close to you anymore if its over

 the only one to feel low because if you want 
 ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered 
 from all that ive done wrong

 im home at the same time 
 highbury estates fine 
 smoking like a dragon but dont chase lines i havent slept for the past week

 think im being shunned by my feet again its not a homeless life for me its just im home less than id like to be and its not a homeless life for me and now im sitting on a night bus 
 flicking through my ipod 
 feeling kinda tired 
 so i try to close my eyes up

 lights on on stage mics on song plays nice one

Ed Sheeran,+,Lately,0,pop,"i seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
 awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 jetlagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any 
 clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many 
 although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon 
 cause i heard that time waits for nobody i suppose its true 
 we make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables 
 to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme 
 so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 cause real will recognise real is what my father says 
 and ill be sticking to this phrase until i pass away 
 overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow but ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 5 oclock with lights off 
 interview with a vampire 
 sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require 
 i swear i said that ill sleep when im dead 
 whos on the beat upon the feature with ed its dev to the z 
 overtired palefaced like michael myers 
 bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage ive acquired 
 and over the time within this maze ill think youll find youll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 
 cause i got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take 4 seconds out the game 
 its time to wage war 
 scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 im haling from the essex and the east london boarder line 
 villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 be wide awake just like your snorting lines or get left mortified like youve just seen the ghost of jesus walking by 
 i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be the times im living in i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be 
 the times im living in lately i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 deliver the raps how i flow 
 i live with the raps now and those that hate me call me ron 
 but they wont slytherin too easy believe me im snape minded 
 be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that im in 
 its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows 
 some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with silocon 
 im still broke without the money for a mac pro living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow 
 opposite of sober cause i never did my homework 
 which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older 
 i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie 
 await death take deep breaths try to never die 
 never die 
 2 guys with the same view keep it tight like screws 
 making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes 
 and if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze 
 times elapsing while your catching zs the masses like to move 
 we scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 driven young gentlemen 
 ive hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months causei havent slept in them true 
 im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so im correcting em 
 we got the fans all like oh wow its devs and ed what less did you bloody expect from em 
 in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 fighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got 
 i keep my pupils engaged 
 like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake 
 i never sleep 
 when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be

Ed Sheeran,+,Family,0,pop,"hmm let me go 
 to see my family 
 please father let me go 
 as my mother sleeps i dont know about days gone 
 but round here nobody lives twice 
 when your gone your gone without no bye 
 because only a judge can give you life 
 this is my advice 
 trust me i nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after i got this rhyme 
 it seems like i had too much wine 
 which that i i didnt get one 
 anyway i was going to the booked for a set 
 even though i didnt have a set one 
 skream hit the decks i was like check one 
 put on a show but it werent my best one 
 left it dropped off blacks at his destination 
 then i was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later i was on the m1 
 tired 
 but i kept on going 
 fell asleep without even knowing 
 no motion in my face 
 no movement in my legs but the car still kept going 
 woke up 
 lorry 
 flash 
 panic 
 break 
 skid 
 crash 
 skidded 
 more 
 bang 
 smash 
 out 
 cold 
 ribs 
 cracked 
 ouch 
 i was in so much pain 
 crawled out of a megan that now looked like a mini 
 when i was still on the first lane 
 baffled didnt even know my name 
 fainted too much shock in my brain 
 surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 trying to get up but fainted again 
 i just want you to take a second hear me out 
 dont think im happy cuz i smile when you see me out 
 ive had serious madnesses where ive nearly disappeared 
 oh im begging lord to save me and let me go 
 to see my family 
 and keep it inside 
 dry eyes while my brother weeps 
 save my soul 
 please father let me go 
 keep me safe as my mother sleeps eyes closed they just wouldnt open 
 i can hear voices and my phone ringing 
 fighting for life cant tell if im winning 
 one of the worst situations ive been in 
 i can hear all of the angels singing but when it stopped humming 
 my brain turned on stared running 
 still in pain but it started numbing 
 the stone cold comeback i made was stunning 
 i still tried to do a few shows cuz i didnt wanna tell them that i werent coming 
 but i was left with a permanent problem 
 nobody knows about the pain that im in inside 
 ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later jogging and running 
 i used the first air kit like a drum set 
 picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming 
 trust me when it comes to mistakes 
 you cant afford to let one in 
 never done dream for a while 
 the black plan was blocked 
 so i learnt and done a bit of plumbing 
 they say tomorrow never dies 
 but he forgot to tell you you can 
 you can have a sicker clan than wutang 
 but when your times up thats it its you fam 
 you can try beg for another 
 sometimes ill be on my way to a show 
 thinking i just wanna see my brother 
 then do a uturn im gone runner i just want you to take a second hear me out 
 dont think im happy cuz i smile when you see me out

Ed Sheeran,+,Little Lady,0,pop,"listen 
 little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday 
 its 30 degrees thursday 
 you work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes 
 lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night 
 you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 you drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry 
 forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 youll make a trip to the whittington were theyll look at your jaw 
 theyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 theyll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 but young woman 
 the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 medical attention could be fatal 
 cause the cunt wouldnt ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him 
 cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in ed sheeran shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cos in the pipe shell fly to the motherland and 
 sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside for angels to fly 2 mikill pane little lady your mind youve made up 
 your injurys you cant hide with makeup 
 you need some medical advice you make up 
 a little lie to say just 
 in case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb 
 with any luck youll see the same dude who stiched your top lip 
 last year when your pimp just lost it 
 he wouldnt recognise if you stared him in the face anyway 
 cos all the heroin is making you age 
 but your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag 
 the funds you have left go where your from using moneygram 
 mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 little does she know your never coming back 
 she put you in her brothers hand only for him to formulate another plan 
 hes the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer 
 fancy that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn ed sheeran shes just under the upper hand 
 goes mad for a couple grams 
 she dont wanna go outside tonight 
 cos in the pipe shell fly to the motherland and sell love to another man 
 its too cold outside for angels to fly 
 now an angel will die covered in white 
 with closed eyes hoping for a better life 
 this time well fade out tonight 
 straight down the line 3 mikill pane little lady your trembling with fear 
 your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear 
 your sitting facing the detective oh dear 
 the meddling nurse couldnt just leave it 
 shes only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 shell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused 
 your causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 the coppers trying to calm you telling you he wont let no one harm you 
 the same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for 
 hes talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore 
 your having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 its kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before 
 just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that its hard 
 he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 begs you to use it 
 hes useless if your gonna be stupid 
 cos an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips your on your own

Ed Sheeran,+,Goodbye to You,0,pop,"hey can you hear me 
 i just wanted to let you know hmm i hope you can hear what i write to you 
 how could i say goodbye to you 
 when im a life that came out of the inside of a life 
 that was inside of 
 you 
 i gotta respect the way you provided food for the 
 whole fam you 
 came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of 
 hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day rest in 
 life in you working but you were never stressed free 
 just locked in a cage slaving they said they were 
 gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to 
 amazement broke your heart but still you were prone 
 to last and your sorrow was over fast i hope your 
 listening right i still think of you every sunday no 
 one can top your chicken and rice even through the 
 darkness times you held us all up cause your vision was 
 bright i knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 you never let anyone see your heartache you just got 
 on with it anyone tells me that they knew you said 
 you were beautiful and your words you would stand 
 strong with it cause they were like warmth on a winter 
 night but i was just too young to go on with it and 
 there somethings i could try to do but its an 
 impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to 
 you i couldnt do that i owe my life to you 
 and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign i 
 hope this pain will heal in time you know i never want 
 to be alone ohh 
 i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and 
 will you think of me up there can i say goodbye to 
 you and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace can i say 
 goodbye to you ohh 
 i think you phoney i was younger with the knowledge of 
 things that i know now i would be by your side when you 
 needed me instead of asking you nan can i go out 
 standing in a road with the gangs that i know now 
 everyones missing you loads jessicas grown up 
 warren lauren and alex are fine and imp living with 
 hope its been a while since ive seen c and the 
 mouths i miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing 
 with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time 
 goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have never been funny in my heart the only one that dissed 
 me was sonia she took all our inheritance money left 
 the rest of us to pick up the pieces i never forgive 
 the way she betrayed us there ent a big enough reason 
 before i sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing 
 but i guess that everyones different or should i say 
 no ones perfect she had happiness in front of her but 
 chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing since you 
 gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is 
 my next step i got all the bricks and the cement but 
 its hard when its done i dont know what to expect 
 so give me the strength that i need to perform this 
 task make it right i must do and i ask cause i trust 
 you it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you 
 and of the pieces of my soul because i need a sign i 
 hope this pain will heal in time you know i never wanna 
 be aloneeeeee 
 i can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air 
 and will you think of me up there can i say goodbye to 
 you and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 or feel the chill of your warm embrace can i say 
 goodbye to you ohh 
 its just for now so i should hush ill never get 
 enough ill see you when i see you but i miss you ohh 
 how i miss you its just for now so i should hush 
 ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but i 
 miss you ohh how i miss you 
 there ent enough words to describe how sorry i am for 
 the pain that i caused sorry for when i stuck up my 
 own blood we were young he said i was rape and he broad 
 and for the day police came to the door im sorry for 
 being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and 
 making you mourn i never been able to say this 
 before cause ive was so inconsiderate you love me 
 unconditionally and i took advantage of it like a idiot 
 not seeing the pure soul that i was living with i 
 really hope that you can forgive me you going away 
 was a punishment but i wont let go im holding you 
 with me but i still fight the emotions within me 
 you see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and 
 will you think of me up there can i say goodbye to you

 and that was the first day and darling it was good 
 never looking down 
 and right there where we stood 
 was holy ground spinning like a girl in a brand new dress 
 we had this big wide city all to ourselves 
 we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you 
 and for the first time i had something to lose 
 and i guess we fell apart in the usual way 
 and the storys got dust on every page 
 but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now 
 and i see your face in every crowd cause darling it was good 
 never looking down 
 and right there where we stood 
 was holy ground tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through 
 but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you 
 tonight im gonna dance like you were in this room 
 but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you it was good

 in fair verona where we lay our scene 
 from ancient grudge break to new mutiny 
 where civil blood makes civil hands unclean 
 from forth the fatal loins of these two foes

 whose misadventured piteous overthrows 
 do with their death bury their parents strife 
 the fearful passage of their deathmarkd love 
 and the continuance of their parents rage 
 which but their childrens end nought could remove 
 is now the two hours traffic of our stage 
 the which if you with patient ears attend 
 what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend i am a child of a
