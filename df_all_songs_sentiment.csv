Eminem & 50 Cent),"Yeah, I was born a misfit 
 Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich 
 Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence 
 I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick 
 ""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"" 
 And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin' 
 My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list 
 Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted"" 
 My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with 
 Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted 
 My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick 
 I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business 
 And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em 
 20 years old is when I came in the game 
 And now it's eight years on and you remember the name 
 And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today 
 But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great 
 I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware 
 Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked 
 You know I want way more than I already got 
 Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club 
  
  
 You know it ain't my time to call it a day 
 I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid

 I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh) 
 From Taco Bell to TRL 
 I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until 
 As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict 
 Funny 'cause I had pop appeal 
 But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?) 
 And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?) 
 In my eyelids now (What?) 
 I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah) 
 Without a doubt, by any means 
 If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em 
 I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes 
 Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between 
 You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams 
 Not even when I'm on my deathbed 
 Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet 
 So why would I quit? 
 The thought that I would stop when I'm dead 
 Just popped in my head 
 I said it, then forgot what I said

 You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip 
 Man, you know just what I mean 
 Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it 
 Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it? 
 Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin' 
 It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em 
 She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit 
 Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money? 
 Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles 
 Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow 
 The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit 
 Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit 
 Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober 
 Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

 Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine 
 I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride 
 The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind 
 So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life 
 Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride 
 And when the world's against me is when I really come alive 
 And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride 
 You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs 
 I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun 
 I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up 
 Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become 
 Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me 
 Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree 
 To be caught up in the trappings of the industry 
 Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key 
 And you'll see 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more 
  
  
 Another one to take the sting away 
 I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
 Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
  
  
 I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs 
 I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong 
 I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell 
 Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well 
 And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps 
 Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun 
 Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run 
 I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become 
 Conversations with my father on the A14 
 Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams 
 Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me 
 With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans 
 Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou' 
 I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud 
 And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed 
 The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now 
 Somehow 
  
  
 I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me 
 But with that said give me one more 
  
  
 Another one to take the sting away 
 Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay 
 Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
 And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser 
  
  
 Welcome to the new show 
 I guess you know I've been away 
 But where I'm heading, who knows? 
 But my heart will stay the same

 You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat 
 Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

 And how your family is doing okay 
 Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
 Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

 I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans 
 Goes to the gym at least six times a week 
 Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet 
 And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats 
 He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached 
 Owns every single Ministry CD 
 Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means 
 But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me 
 But still, I'm just keepin' it real 
 Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil' 
 I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back 
 'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at 
 Let me remind you of the days when 
 You used to hold my hand 
 And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans 
 I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman 
 Just a young boy tryin' to be loved 
 So let me give it to ya

 Your new man rents a house in the 'burb 
 And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse 
 Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas 
 Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous 
 He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime 
 And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign 
 Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"" 
 But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you 
 You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin' 
 Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin' 
 Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym 
 Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim 
 In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him 
 Okay, you need to be alone 
 And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone

 Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance 
 Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance? 
 Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence 
 Oh well, she’s a local girl 
 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man 
 It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after 
 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese 
 And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need 
 I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley 
 She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi 
 Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat 
 B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly 
 She knows me well 
 Bit of a catch to have a local girl 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake 
  
  
 I never sleep

 I don't know about James bond 
 But round here nobody lives twice 
 When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye 
 Cause only a judge can give you life 
 This is my advice 
 Trust me, I nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after I got this ride 
 Pissed like I had way too much wine 
 Wished I didn't get one 
 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this

 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there?

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in 
  
  
 When the darkness creeps in 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 And when my dreams are sleeping 
 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 I feel my nightmares watching me

 Watching me 
  
  
 You better wake up cause I A.M making moves 
 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one

 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me 
  
  
 I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
 Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you?

 Glass on the side 
 I've been sat with you 
 For most of the night 
 Ignorin' everybody here 
 We wish they would disappear 
 So maybe we could get down now 
 And I don't wanna know 
 If you're gettin' ahead of the program 
 I want you to be mine, lady 
 To hold your body close 
 Take another step into the no-man's land 
 And for the longest time, lady 
  
  
 I need you darling 
 Come on, set the tone

 Won’t you let me know

 Come on, get involved

 This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage 
 And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days 
 Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know 
 But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke 
 Let it go until our roads are changed 
 Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave 
 No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say 
 But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray 
 I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you"" 
 Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila 
 I already know if she's a keeper 
 Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in 
 Deep shit if anybody finds out 
 I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now 
 Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch 
 One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth 
  
  
 I need you darling

 Can you feel it?

 But can you feel it? 
 Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'? 
 Before the beat kicks in again

 And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell 
 Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer 
 Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder? 
 Under the covers where we used to lay 
 And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played 
 I'd be on tour almost every day 
 When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay 
 Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed 
 Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe 
 We used each other's air just for the people to see 
 And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep 
 We go anywhere, our minds would take us 
 And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up 
 And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause 
 We can all be loved the way that God made us 
 And time's the only reason that we could break up 
 Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much 
 Distance is relative to the time that it takes 
 To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again 
  
  
 Oh Nina 
 You should go, Nina 
 Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now? 
 And I've been living on the road, Nina 
 But then again you should know, Nina 
 Cause that’s you and me both, Nina 
 Oh, won't you leave me now, now? 
  
  
 And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie 
 With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold 
 Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 
 Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone 
 Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits 
 Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish 
 Back to the burrow with all the Celtics 
 I disappear, you call me selfish 
 I understand but I can’t help it 
 I put my job over everything except my family and friends 
 But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back 
 Overlook the situation 
 Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications 
 And I'm not saying we should be taking a break 
 Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late 
 So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane 
 But in a day we'll have to say it again

 But you can't make it on your own

 Disappearing all night 
 I don’t wanna know where he's been lying 
 I know what I wanna do 
 Wanna runaway, runaway with you 
 Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go 
  
  
 How long you leaving? 
 Well, Dad just don’t expect me back this evening 
 Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this 
 It’s been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but 
  
  
 I love him from my skin to my bones 
 But I don’t wanna live in his home 
 There’s nothing to say cause he knows

 Cold as stone in the kitchen light

 I could be persuaded to hold on 
 Mama was the same 
 None of us are saints I guess that God knows that

 Put my home in a suitcase 
 Tie both shoe laces, and hope that

 Just wish you'd never gone for the man 
 And waited two weeks at least 
 Before you let him take you 
 I stayed true, I kind of knew 
 You liked the dude from private school 
 He's waiting for the time to move 
 I knew he had his eyes on you 
 He's not the right guy for you 
 Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth 
 No, I would never lie to you 
 But it was never fine to lose you 
 And what a way to find out 
 It never came from my mouth 
 You never changed your mind 
 But you were just afraid to mind out 
 But  it 
 I won't be changing the subject, I love it 
 I'll make your little secret public 
 It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons 
 You sleep with in your closet to get back at me 
 Trapped and I'm lacking sleep 
 Fact is you're mad at me 
 Because I backtrack so casually 
 You're practically my family 
 If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be 
 But tragically our love just lost the will to live 
 But would I kill to give it one more shot? 
 I think not 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no 
 Anymore 
  
  
 Recently I tend to zone out 
 Up in my headphones to Holocene 
 You promised your body but I'm away so much 
 I stay more celibate than in a monastery 
 I'm not cut out for life on the road 
 'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much 
 And at the time we'd just go, so sue me 
 I guess I'm not the man that you need 
 Ever since you went to uni 
 I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack 
 Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad 
 But when I broke the industry 
 That's when I broke your heart 
 I was supposed to chart and celebrate 
 But good things are over fast 
 I know it's hard to deal with and see this 
 I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features 
 Then I turn the music off 
 And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus 
 I never really want to believe this 
 Got advice from my dad and he 
 Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need 
 I guess I'm unaware of it 
 Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with 
  
  
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't want you no 
 Anymore 
 I don't love you baby 
 I don't need you baby 
 I don't wanna love you no

 And since you left, I've given up my days off 
 It's what I need to stay strong 
 I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 
 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook 
 'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could 
 The irony is if my career in music didn't exist 
 In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid 
 I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink 
 And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's 
 Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill 
 And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill 
 Go down in history as just a wasted talent 
 Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ? 
 It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me 
 Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be 
 Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this 
 These things happen for a reason and you can't change  
 Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty 
 But I had to get this off my chest

 I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know 
 You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in 
 I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden 
 Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision 
 Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism 
 Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen 
 Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven 
 And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager 
 I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather 
 I'll do my own thing now and get respect after 
 And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter 
 For four years I never had a place to stay 
 But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight 
 At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home 
 I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked 
 And went from sleeping at a subway station 
 To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population 
 Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax 
 Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 I take it back with the rhythm and blues 
 With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news 
 Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school 
 I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop 
 Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes 
 I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth 
 And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit 
 They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot 
 But then again that's what they're supposed to do 
 And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm 
 Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on"" 
 I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song 
 And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong 
 But then I've never had an enemy except the NME 
 But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be 
 With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees 
 Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree 
 Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids 
 I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic 
 I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it 
 This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No, I'll take it back now 
  
  
 Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 
 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless 
 And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed 
 Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus 
 Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton 
 Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless 
 Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 
 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written 
 Now absence can make your heart ache 
 But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state 
 Vividly, need to let my liver be 
 And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends 
 It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me 
 And I hope to see him blowing up globally 
 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally 
 It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but 
 But I just write schemes 
 I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans 
 Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely 
 You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates 
 Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made 
 And every single second knowing that we'll never betray 
 The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down 
 That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now 
  
  
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
 Mmm, come on and take it back, love 
 Come on and take it back for us 
 Don't you fade into the back, love 
 No 
  
  
 My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme 
 Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? 
 With this you must know that the numbers just sold 
 Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me 
 We forget 90 percent of it when we wake 
 But the other 10 percent, it never fades 
 Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads 
 Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade 
 Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more 
 A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought 
 You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors 
 Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour 
 Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit 
 You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick 
 I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss 
 And most of these other guys are kids that pose 
 His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is 
 Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it 
 Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower 
 You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow 
 Igh!","i'm not a rapper, i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old, yeah, i moved out of my home i was macy gray, i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination, i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax? i'll take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack, i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm, i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering, ""everything that happens is from now on"" i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect, and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart, covered the planet, i'll take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no, i'll take it back now  now, i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly, need to let my liver be and i'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be, i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be, but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid, discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down that's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now  mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no mmm, come on and take it back, love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back, love no  my dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme till i deliver the hype, am i just living a lie?

 Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence

 No make-up cause she knows me well 
 Hair tied up in elastic band 
 With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

 And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her 
 So she buys me chips and cheese 
 And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need

 She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi 
 Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat 
 B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly

 Fill it up with bubbles 
 'Cause maybe you're loveable 
 Maybe you're my snowflake 
 And your eyes turn from green to gray 
 And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place 
 And you should never cut your hair 
 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder 
  
  
 And you will never know 
 Just how beautiful you are to me 
 But maybe I'm just in love 
 When you wake me up 
  
  
 And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me 
 Could you make me a cup of tea 
 To open my eyes in the right way 
 And I know you love Shrek 
 'Cause we've watched it 12 times 
 And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too 
 And if your DVD breaks today 
 You should've got a VCR 
 Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say 
 I know I've always been shit at computer games 
 And your brother always beats me 
 And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV 
 And then you laugh at me 
 And be asking me 
 If I'm gonna be home next week 
 And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep 
 And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

 You always try and get me to stop 
 But you drink as much as me 
 And I get drunk a lot 
 So I’ll take you to the beach 
 And walk along the sand 
 And I'll make you a heart pendant 
 With a pebble held in my hand 
 And I'll carve it like this necklace 
 So the heart falls where your chest is 
 Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach 
 And it falls just where it needs to be 
 And rests peacefully 
 So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now 
 Against yours now 
 Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up 
 Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up","i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it 12 times and maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a blu-ray, true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost, i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so i’ll take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up",-0.1,0.8

Devlin),"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be 
 Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees 
 Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe 
 Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep 
 Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any 
 Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many 
 Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 
 Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true 
 We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths 
 To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves 
 I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme 
 So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine 
 Cause real recognise real is what my father says 
 And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away 
 Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow 
 But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close 
  
  
 5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire 
 Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require 
 I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed? 
 It's D-E-V to the Zed 
 Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers 
 Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired 
 And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll 
 Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying 
 Cause I got too much to stay awake for 
 To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war 
 Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 
 Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight 
 I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line 
 Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes 
 Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines 
 Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by 
  
  
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in 
 I never sleep 
 When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free 
 It could be 
 The times I'm living in lately 
  
  
 I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth 
 And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out 
 Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those 
 That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy 
 Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be 
 On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in 
 It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with 
 Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in 
 I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows 
 Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone 
 I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro 
 Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow 
 Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework 
 Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older 
 I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie 
 I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die) 
  
  
 Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge 
 Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes 
 And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze 
 Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move 
 We scan the situation, analyse information 
 And then decide what probably is most practical to do 
 Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets 
 At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true 
 I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em 
 We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" 
 What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" 
 In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment 
 Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock 
 And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got 
 I keep my pupils engaged 
 Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

 Please, Father, let me go 
 As my mother sleeps 
  
  
 I don't know about James bond 
 But round here nobody lives twice 
 When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye 
 Cause only a judge can give you life 
 This is my advice 
 Trust me, I nearly lost my life 
 3 weeks after I got this ride 
 Pissed like I had way too much wine 
 Wished I didn't get one 
 Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set 
 Even though I didn't have a set one 
 Skream hit the decks, I was like check one 
 Put on a show, but it weren't my best one 
 Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination 
 Then I was off to the next one 
 20 minutes later I was on the M1 
 Tired, but I kept on going 
 Fell asleep without even knowing 
 No motion in my face 
 No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going 
 Woke up, lorry, flash 
 Panic, break, skid, crash 
 Skidded more, bang, smash 
 Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch 
 I was in so much pain 
 Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini 
 When I was still on the first lane 
 Baffled, didn't even know my name 
 Fainted, too much shock in my brain 
 Surrounded by paramedics and feds 
 Trying to get up but fainted again 
  
  
 See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out 
 Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out 
 I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared 
 And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go 
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps 
 Save my soul 
 Please, Father, let me go 
 Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps 
  
  
 Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open 
 I could hear voices and my phone ringing 
 Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning 
 One of the worst situations I've been in 
 I could hear all of the angels singing 
 But when they stopped humming 
 My brain turned on, started running 
 Still in pain, but it started numbing 
 The stone cold comeback I made was stunning 
 I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming 
 But I was left with a permanent problem 
 Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (sly) 
 Ever so cunning 
 6 weeks later, jogging and running 
 I used the first aid kit like a drum set 
 Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming 
 Trust me, when it comes to mistakes 
 You can't afford to let one in 
 Never done tunes for a while 
 The pipeline was blocked 
 So I learned and done a bit of plumbing 
 They say tomorrow never dies 
 But they forgot to tell you, you can 
 You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang 
 But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam 
 You can try beg for another 
 Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show 
 Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother"" 
 Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up 
  
  
  
  
 To see my family 
 And keep it inside 
 Dry eyes, while my brother weeps

 There was a time when radio played me 
 'Cause my music came from my heart 
 It was real to me, but now it's a par 
 I'm here struggling, keeping it real 
 While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal 
 Sometimes I sit back and think 
 ""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"" 
 The reason I started making music is the exact same 
 Reason that I'll never do it, I swear 
 I didn't go through all of that for this 
 I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is 
 I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different? 
 Look at me, determined, man on a mission 
 My music is me, and I am my music 
 So like it or lump it, I'mma do this 
  
  
 I never had a playlist in my heart 
 Now I need an A list just to chart 
 But I've been famous from the start 
 How am I gonna make my mark? 
  
  
 Are you gonna play me though? 
 This song was never meant for the radio 
 (I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing 
 And I don't have time for a playlist) 
 How much will you pay me though 
 If this song's not a hit on the radio? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 Thank God for night clubs and the raves 
 'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves 
 Unless we water it down 
 But cordial music is boring me now 
 I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is 
 Or in this music scene, what your role is 
 I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer 
 I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears 
 See I'm just telling you the truth 
 Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth 
 You won't hear me on the radio 
 But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof 
 Why is that? What's going on there? 
 To tell you the truth, I don't really care 
 I am my music, my music is me 
 Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
  
  
 I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial 
 Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile 
 So won't you hear me out? 
 Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club 
 Maybe I could take time singing for the dub 
 So won't you hear me out?

 This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday 
 You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes 
 Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night 
 You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try 
 And you remember that your punter went crazy last night 
 You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry 
 Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for 
 You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw 
 They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure 
 They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door 
 But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker 
 Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't 
 Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 
 Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 Little lady, your mind you've made up 
 Your injuries you can't hide with make-up 
 You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just 
 In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb 
 With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip 
 Last year when your pimp just lost it 
 He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 
 Cause all the heroin is making you age 
 But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag 
 The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram 
 Mother had to get you out the motherland to study 
 That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand 
 Little does she know you're never coming back? 
 She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan 
 He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer 
 Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn 
  
  
 She's just under the upper hand 
 Goes mad for a couple grams 
 And she don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
  
  
 An angel will die 
 Covered in white 
 Closed eyes and hoping for a better life 
 This time, we'll fade out tonight 
 Straight down the line 
  
  
 Little lady, you're trembling with fear 
 Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer 
 You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear 
 The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it 
 She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and 
 She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused 
 You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now 
 The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you 
 The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?"" 
 He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore 
 You're having a conversation you could be murdered for 
 You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court 
 It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before 
 Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard 
 He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card 
 Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid 
 Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own 
 You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe 
 You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home 
 Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat 
 And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know"" 
 No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness 
 You open the front door, he boots you in 
 There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror 
 Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error 
 He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight 
 At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped 
 And all the contents are all over the floor 
 Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye 
 And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece 
 And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street 
 Little lady left this earth in the worst way 
 All because she got a card on her 13th birthday 
  
  
 And we're all under the upper hand 
 And go mad for a couple grams 
 And we don't wanna go outside, tonight 
 Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and 
 Sell love to another man 
 It's too cold outside 
 For angels to fly 
 For angels to fly 
 Fly, fly 
 For angels to fly 
 To fly, to fly

 But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see 
 And I vowed that my breathing will never cease 
 To the retrieve then I can't let them be 
 I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 
 But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green 
 Now I'm in the magazines almost every week 
 Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife 
 Right now it's better than it's ever been 
 Never fade like a plant that's evergreen 
 It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me 
 Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak 
 Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be 
 They chase dreams together like a slumber party 
 And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing 
 I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

 I feel my nightmares watching me 
 And when my dreams are sleeping

 You better wake up cause I A.M making moves 
 And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules 
 I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training 
 Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze 
 Made my bed and that's where I'm heading 
 I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em 
 Married to the game was a quiet wedding, and I had to fight to get her 
 I am tekken (taking) control of my inception 
 Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection 
 See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back 
 Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them 
 See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish 
 Cause the haters know where the family lives 
 Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger 
 Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did 
 They say sleep is the cousin of death 
 But I ain't hearing that shit, cousin I'm deaf 
 Gang signs I'm in LA reading (LA Reid'n) 
 I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next

 They're watching me, they watch me sleep 
 Let me go 
 I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality 
 And daydream about losing my sanity 
 I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow 
 So I can see an off note with my eyes closed 
 But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep 
 I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat 
 I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep 
 See, all the dreams I'm fond of 
 You placed me in the team insomnia 
 Now, I'm Mr hard worker 
 In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up 
 And I missed my chance, worst luck 
 Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner 
 Yeah, but I walked from that ish 
 Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

 I just wanted to let you know, hmm 
  
  
 I hope you can hear what I write to you 
 How could I say goodbye to you? 
 When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you 
 I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam 
 You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man 
 Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels 
 Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 
 3 jobs in a day 
 Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free 
 Just locked in a cage slaving 
 They said they were gold in the pavements 
 But you came and saw the road to amazement 
 Broke your heart 
 But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast 
 I hope your listening right 
 I still think of you every Sunday 
 No one can top your chicken and rice 
 Even through the darkness times 
 You held us all up because your vision was bright 
 I knew your strength was your wisdom inside 
 You never let anyone see your heartache 
 You just got on with it 
 Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful 
 And your words you would stand strong with it 
 Cause they were like warmth on a winter night 
 But I was just too young to go on with it 
 And there somethings I could try to do 
 But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you 
 I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 I think you phoney 
 I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now 
 I would be by your side when you needed me 
 Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" 
 Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now 
 Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up 
 Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope 
 It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths 
 I miss seeing a family, being a family 
 And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child 
 But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer 
 Family problems have never been funny 
 In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia 
 She took all our inheritance money 
 Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces 
 I never forgive the way she betrayed us 
 There ain't a big enough reason 
 Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing 
 But I guess that everyone's different 
 Or should I say no one's perfect? 
 She had happiness in front of her 
 But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing 
 Since you gone the foundations crumbled 
 So building it back up is my next step 
 I got all the bricks and the cement but 
 It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect 
 So give me the strength that I need to perform this task 
 Make it right, I must do 
 And I ask cause I trust you 
 It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you 
  
  
 And of the pieces of my soul 
 (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) 
 You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh 
  
  
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
 It's just for now so I should hush 
 I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but 
 I miss you, oh how I miss you 
  
  
 There ain't enough words to describe 
 How sorry I am for the pain that I caused 
 Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood 
 We were young and he said it was raping his broad 
 And for the day police came to the door 
 I'm sorry for being such a bad youth 
 Stealing from your purse and making you mourn 
 I never been able to say this before 
 Cause I was so inconsiderate 
 You loved me unconditionally 
 And I took advantage of it like a idiot 
 Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with 
 I really hope that you can forgive me 
 You going away was a punishment 
 But I won't let go I'm holding you with me 
 But I still fight the emotions within me 
  
  
 I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face 
 Feel the chill of your warm embrace? 
 And can I say goodbye to you? 
 I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air 
 And will you think of me up there? 
 Can I say goodbye to you? 
 And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face 
 Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?

 Maybe, or am I just seeing shit? 
 Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear 
  
  
 You don't even wanna know about the things I hear 
 Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deer 
 I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position 
 You'll be fishing for far too long 
 You're the bad guy in this movie 
 And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution 
 And the only solution is making shit confusing 
  
  
 Ain't about who's winnin' or losin' 
 It's 'bout the path you're choosin'

 When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising 
 Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings 
 I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring 
 A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality 
 Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity 
 Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me 
  
  
 Bulls eye, you the dot to me 
 Emotions splattered, same pattern, can't even begin to spot 'em

 You can search the world but you will never find 
 I see everything you've done to me, be there, you run to me 
 I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina 
 If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya

 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free 
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas 
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me 
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace 
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef

 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way? 
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say 
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'? 
  
  
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?

 You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street 
 (Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can) 
 I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer? 
 What the fuck happened? (Oh no!) 
 I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars 
 Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)

 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
 Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two

 You goat-mouth mammyfucker 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help 
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!"" 
 I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too 
 Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo! 
 Aw, yeah, fuck the judge 
 I made it past twenty-five, and there I was 
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him 
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina 
 Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"" 
 Limo tinted with the gold plates 
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah) 
  
  
 Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot* 
 By the time you hear the next pop 
 The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot* 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' 
 King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

 Life to me, like a box of chocolate 
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it 
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
 K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged 
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards 
 You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses 
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me 
  
  
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
  
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, God bless the kid 
 Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 
  
  
 ""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips 
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor 
 Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for 
 Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this? 
 One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist 
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him 
 Quickly because he got it 
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds? 
 No more livin' poor, meet my four-four 
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
 But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey 
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
 Well, that's me at these awards"" 
 I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy 
 She said... 
  
  
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down 
  
  
 And once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, dazed and confused 
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
 You can take your boy out the hood 
 But you can't take the hood out the homie 
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey 
 Hollywood's nervous

 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me, I’m just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I’m here 
 These walls never could hold up

 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I’ve been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them 
 I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em 
 I’d rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

 Race wars happening, no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper

 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?

 Or leave his best friend, little brother 
 You promised you’d watch him before they shot him

 You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit

 This feelin' is unmatched 
 This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap 
 Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west) 
 We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west) 
 Been in it before internet had new acts 
 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack 
 My innocence limited, the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision 
 Kendrick is master that mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic 
 Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque 
 But what's better than that? 
 The fact it brought me back home

 I know fatality might haunt you

 I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors 
 I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma 
 I know everything, I know history 
 I know the universe works mentally 
 I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me 
 I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money 
 I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery 
 I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies 
 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District 
 Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed 
 I know how people work 
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth 
 I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget

 I met a little boy that resembled my features 
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile 
 Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted 
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin' 
 He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language 
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous 
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken 
 But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it 
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor 
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 And that was bullshit 
 I know your life is full of turmoil 
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you 
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two 
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace 
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially 
 To come back home""

 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
 ""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 20 years ago, can't forget 
 Now I can lend him a ear or two 
 How to stack these residuals tenfold 
 The liberal concept of what men'll do 
 ""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
 My American tongue was leery 
 Walked out the gas station 
 A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion 
 Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land 
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
 He begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
 Told him, ""Beat it"" 
 Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it 
 He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
 Nothin' less, nothin' more"" 
 I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost? 
  
  
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
  
  
 He's starin' at me in disbelief 
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave 
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger 
 Like I was supposed to save him 
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
 And this particular person just had it down pat 
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 ""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? 
 A humble man is all that we ever need"" 
 Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
 I never met a transient that demanded attention 
 They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
 So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum 
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines 
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
 I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind 
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend 
 I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin 
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' 
 I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal 
 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre 
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
 He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet"" 
 I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep"" 
 He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free 
 You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power 
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit 
 The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"" 
  
  
 I washed my hands, I said my grace 
 What more do you want from me?

 Color of your skin? Color of your eyes

 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey

 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas

 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored 
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times 
 If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion 
 It ain’t complex to put it in context 
 Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context 
 Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest 
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
 Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be 
 I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey 
 I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens 
 And spike your self-esteem 
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me 
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
 And it’s all beautiful to me 
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing

 Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village 
 Pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me don't you? 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You're fuckin' evil 
 I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, makin' a killin' 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
  
  
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
  
  
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back

 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean

 Curse me till I'm dead 
 Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head 
 Institutionalized manipulation and lies 
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 You hate me don't you? 
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
 Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
 Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you? 
 How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?

 When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree 
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
 It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification 
 I'm African-American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan 
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
 Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all 
 That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you? 
 You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you 
 I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle 
 Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him 
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
 Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
 Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score 
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
 Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers"" 
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
 Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
 Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street 
 When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

 How many times the city making me promises? 
 So I promise this, nigga

 With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic

 I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night) 
 I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent 
 Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message

 From a negative and letting them annihilate me 
 And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed

 Sound like I needed some soul searching 
 My Pops gave me some game in real person 
 Retraced my steps on what they never taught me 
 Did my homework fast before government caught me 
 So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah 
 On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us 
 So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us 
 Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia 
 N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen 
 N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish 
 The history books overlook the word and hide it

 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan— 
 (one two, one two) 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
 Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? 
 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
 If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
 Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar? 
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? 
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome 
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing 
 But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question: 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin' 
 Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And with that— 
  
  
 Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her? 
 You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur? 
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt? 
 You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired? 
 Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time? 
 Like, who got your best interest? 
 Like, how much are you dependent? 
 How clutch are the people that say they love you? 
 And who pretending? 
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in? 
 Do you show forgiveness? 
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? 
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? 
 What kind of bridge did they burn? 
 Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned 
 You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
 You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom 
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
 That considered the blessing of everyone 
 This your lesson for everyone, say; 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin' 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga— 
  
  
 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you 
 That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson 
 I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is 
 So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me? 
 Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be? 
 See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs 
 Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law 
 Generation X—will I ever be your ex? 
 Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause 
 Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all 
 It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
 How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? 
 Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
 Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin 
 Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh 
  
  
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
  
  
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling 
 Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message 
 As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga 
  
  
 ""I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn’t wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city 
 I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man 
 Maybe I’m just another nigga” 
  
 Shit and that’s all I wrote 
 I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain’t really a poem 
 I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to 
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you 
 I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- 
 About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground 
 What you mean by that, what the ground represent? 
  
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil 
 Right 
 That’s how I see it, my word is bond 
 I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people 
 Right 
 The poor people is gonna open up this whole world 
 And swallow up the rich people 
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat 
 And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing 
 The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like 
 You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be... 
 There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- 
 They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying? 
  
 Aight so let me ask you this then 
 Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich 
 Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities? 
  
 I see myself as a natural born hustler 
 A true hustler in every sense of the word 
 I took nothin’, I took the opportunities 
 I worked at the most menial and degrading job 
 And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it 
 I went from having somebody managing me 
 To me hiring the person that works my management company 
 I changed everything, I realized my destiny 
 In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people 
 Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying? 
 I made millions for the record companies 
 I made millions for these movie companies 
 Now I make millions for, for us 
  
 And through your different avenues of success 
 How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity? 
  
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game 
 And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true"" 
 Right 
 You know what I’m saying? 
 And it was happening to me for a reason 
 You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit 
 I was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 So it’s no problem, you know 
 I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know 
 I’m finna go straight through 
  
 Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that 
 Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall? 
  
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance 
 And not only me but, it goes down my family tree 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back 
  
 Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like 
 ""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win 
 And I wanna lay it all down"" 
  
 In this country, a black man only have like 
 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength 
 And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong 
 While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 
 'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like 
 They take the heart and soul out of a man 
 Out of a black man, in this country 
 And you don’t wanna fight no more 
 And if you don’t believe me, you can look around 
 You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers 
  
 That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings 
 Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that 
 There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you 
 What you think is the future for me and my generation today? 
  
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores 
 And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed 
 For real, I don’t think America know that 
 I think America think we was just playing 
 And it’s gonna be some more playing but 
 It ain’t gonna be no playing 
 It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying? 
 It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker 
 You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen 
  
 That’s crazy man, in my opinion 
 Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations 
 Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know 
 Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic 
 And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out 
 Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes 
  
 Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’ 
 We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us 
 Damn 
  
 I wanted to read one last thing to you 
 It’s actually something a good friend had wrote 
 Describing my world, it says: 
 “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it 
 In order to protect itself from this mad city 
 While consuming its environment 
 The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him 
 But praises the butterfly 
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness 
 And the beauty within the caterpillar 
 But having a harsh outlook on life 
 The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak 
 And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 Already surrounded by this mad city 
 The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon 
 Which institutionalizes him 
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts 
 He’s trapped 
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as 
 Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 The result? 
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations 
 That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle 
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different 
 They are one and the same"" 
 What’s your perspective on that?

 Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin' 
 Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked 
 And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas

 Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher 
 And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure 
 And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed 
 And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record

 Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down 
 And listen to this true mothafuckin' story 
 Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch 
  
  
 Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really I'm a sober soul 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And we ain't askin' for no favors 
 Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah 
 Really, I'm a peacemaker 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo) 
 One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out 
 One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you) 
 One day it's gon' burn you 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
  
  
  
  
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota 
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda 
 Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up 
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor 
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble 
 I hope the universe love you today 
 'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away 
 A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate 
 If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted 
 Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent 
 The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it 
 Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses 
 Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls 
 And asked them what they workin' with 
 Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth 
 Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies 
  
  
 Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red 
 Come through and bust ya head, nigga! 
 Me and the homies 
 Sag all the way to the liquor store 
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more 
 Me and the homies 
 I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas 
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in 
 Me and the homies 
 Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka 
 And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!” 
  
  
 It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin' 
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin' 
 Hungry for anything unhealthy 
 And if nutrition can help me 
 I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin' 
 We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester 
 You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses 
 Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there 
 'Cause every time we down there 
 We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards 
 Bougie bitches with no extensions 
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination 
 Before we sparked a conversation 
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like 
 Then started interrogatin' 
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean 
 I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it 
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it 
 That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent 
 Until I'm with the homies 
  
  
 (Just ridin', just ridin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Bullshittin', actin' a fool) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Trippin', really trippin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin') 
  
  
 Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had 
 A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad 
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma 
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya 
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience 
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in 
 But Jeezy still playin' 
 And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?"" 
 Pull in front of the house 
 That we been campin' out for like two months 
 The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want 
  
  
 Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
 Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room! 
 Wait, what?! 
 Nigga, there's somebody in this room! 
  
  
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo 
 DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk 
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right 
 Then made a left, we was just circlin' life 
 My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it."" 
 I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense 
 With the homies 
 But – they made a right, then made a left 
 Then made a right, then another right 
 One lucky night with the homies 
  
  
 K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
 Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded 
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though 
 Ooh, which one? 
 Well, which one he talkin' about? 
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it 
 I pray he ain't hit that 
 Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one 
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! 
 Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe 
 Nigga, for what? 
 What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
 ""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"" 
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there 
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street 
 There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go 
 Look, here's the plan, luv 
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park 
 'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight 
 That's what he's not gon' do 
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30 
 That's straight, but we should meet up around 12 
 I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too

 Hands up high, hands up high

 I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go 
  
  
 I recognize your fragrance 
 Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit 
 Uh, and I know your taste is 
 A little bit, hmm, high maintenance 
 Uh, everybody else basic 
 You live life on an everyday basis 
 With poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room 
 Would you trust it? 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when 
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen 
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em? 
 I really wanna know you all 
 I really wanna show you off 
 Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne 
 Cold nights when you curse this name 
 You called up your girlfriends 
 And y'all curled in that little bitty Range 
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party 
 Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari 
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

 With all these seductive photographs 
 And all these one-off vacations you've been takin' 
 Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense 
 Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man 
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane 
 Take you and your momma to the motherland 
 I could do it, maybe one day 
 When you figure out you're gonna need someone 
 When you figure out it's alright here in the city 
 And you don't run from where we come from 
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice 
 You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted 
 I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex 
 Your natural hair and your soft skin 
 And your big ass in that sundress, ooh 
 Good God, what you doin' that walk for? 
 When I see that thing move 
 I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more 
 They say communication save relations, I can tell

 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror 
 Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe 
 Call me crazy, we can both be insane 
 A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain 
 I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve 
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it

 Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray 
 Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away

 To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"" 
 As the record spin I should pray 
 For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey

 Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue 
 And you understand that I ain't 
 But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble 
 And live in the street with rank 
 No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study 
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
 From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang 
 Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks

 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until 
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will 
 It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still 
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill 
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill 
 All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere 
 As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear 
 But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue 
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof 
 And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo 
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through 
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile 
 I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down

 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell 
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell 
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill 
 You're living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A never relay a guarantee 
 And plan C never could say just what it was 
 And your plans only can pan around love 
 You love him, you love them, you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen"" 
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
 You love French tip and trip that pay for 
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more 
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt

 Your eyes never lie, even if they fell 
 Out the sky and your optics turn stale 
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill 
 Of living in a world that come with plan B 
 Cause plan A only can make another mistake 
 And you can't see success coming from plan C 
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely 
 And love them and love when you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old 
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control 
 Of everything that you love, you love beef 
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police 
 You love your hood, might even love it to death

 The reason why I know you very well 
 Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? 
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal 
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal 
 When living in a world that come with plan B 
 A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free 
 And plan C just an excuse like ""because"" 
 Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love? 
 I love them, I love when I love her 
 I love so much, I love when love hurts 
 I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract 
 I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack 
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch 
 I love what the both of you have to offer 
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else 
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself 
 To the point I should hate everything I do love? 
 Should I hate living my life inside the club? 
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? 
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? 
 Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""? 
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about 
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will 
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real? 
  
  
 Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga 
  
  
 I do what I wanna do 
 I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I 
 Look in the mirror and know I'm there 
 With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real 
 I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone) 
  
  
 Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom 
 Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.""

 This is King Kendrick Lamar 
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw 
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it 
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us 
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor 
 And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning 
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing 
 And if they take everything, know I got 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga 
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic 
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging 
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap 
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month 
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman 
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga 
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga 
 Kendrick Conan nigga 
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that 
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters 
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that 
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats 
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats 
  
  
 Will swarm on me like a beehive 
 Hop in the G ride 
 From the West to the East side 
 Know that's just how Compton roll 
  
  
 And that's a given 
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision 
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes 
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it 
 Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business 
 I blow up every time we throw up a record 
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion 
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 So tell that gangster throw his set high 
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high 
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly 
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I 
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye 
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive 
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye 
 Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby 
  
  
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
  
  
 Now we can all celebrate 
 We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA 
 America target our rap market, as controversy and hate 
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate 
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich 
 And the broke niggas that play 
 With them gorillas that know killers 
 That know where you stay 
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé 
 This was brought to you by Dre 
 Now every motherfucker in here say: 
 ""Look who's responsible 
 For taking Compton international 
 I make 'em holla"" 
  
  
 Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie 
 Just Blaze 
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah 
 In the city of Compton 
 Ain't no city quite like mine

 We established like the Yankees 
 This whole fuckin' game thankless 
 We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin' 
 No limit to where I can take it 
 And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper 
 I thought we looked out for one another 
 Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble 
 I guess it's different in the city I come from 
 All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me 
 They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me 
 The higher I get, the less they accept me 
 Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha 
 No way out 'cause I'm already in it 
 I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket 
 Good business can clean millions, I got the vision 
 I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons"" 
 Even back when I wasn't as poppin' 
 When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road 
 And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky 
 I tried to make the right choices with the world watching 
 ""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"" 
 Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life 
 And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah 
 Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child 
 Can't nobody hold me down 
 Especially not right now 
 Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile 
 Take that, take that 
 No love in they heart so they fake that 
 DiCaprio level the way they play that

 Y'all don't hear no songs 
 They hit my phone like, ""You did that"" 
 They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?"" 
 It's always on some shit like 
 ""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?"" 
 Like I'm about to tell you where she been at 
 Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped 
 She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry 
 Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari 
 All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY 
 She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys 
 My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari 
 Look, now you got me started 
 I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley 
 I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist 
 Always gotta play it smarter 
 Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup 
 Cameras pointing every time I look up 
 That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up 
 Sponsorship dollars is sky high 
 He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"" 
 Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high 
 Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday

 The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face 
 Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake 
 For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe 
 Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays 
 These guys move so greezy nowadays 
 I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it 
 Save my stories for down the line 
 I'm too ahead of the curve every time

 For my niggas, though 
  
  
 Uh, you underestimated greatly 
 Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me? 
 The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me 
 So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety 
 I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards 
 Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper 
 Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter 
 Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga 
 Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya 
 I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya? 
 Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget 
 Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it 
 Damn, this shit could go on a tape 
 Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break 
 Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook 
 That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake 
 Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me? 
 Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team 
 'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas 
 Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas 
 For real, some nobody started feelin' himself 
 A couple somebodies started killin' themself 
 A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf 
 I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help 
 I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation 
 Bad press during the summer over allegations 
 I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money 
 That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming 
 A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement 
 And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear 
 Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga 
 Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous 
 Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans 
 But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses 
 And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans 
 Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings 
 Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's 
 Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco 
 This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon 
 This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real 
 All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills 
 Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil 
 Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill 
 If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real 
 Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase 
 But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates 
 My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race 
 It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe 
 Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10 
 Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again 
 I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again 
 A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up? 
  
  
 Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again

 Start to think I got to get it how I live

 Keep in touch with other women

 On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip 
 I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them 
 Drizzy still got some '06 in him 
 IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on 
 All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on 
 It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game 
 See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane 
 Pay yourself and owe yourself 
 Before you come to my city just know yourself 
 Know where you at 
 I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at 
 The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga 
  
  
 But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is 
 That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like 
 The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just.. 
 Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all 
 We went through errythang... 
 I remember you loved Jodeci 
 I mean like studied, you even made me a CD… 
  
  
 Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out

 I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not 
 I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot 
 Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga 
 I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas 
 Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga 
 I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas 
 You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga 
 I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga 
 Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails 
 And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel 
 That five star in your city, they know where we at

 Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up 
 Wonder where she is, fuck could she be? 
 She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak 
 Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak 
 Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me 
 Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas 
 Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas 
 Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain 
 Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame 
 Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame 
 'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no 
 Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters 
 I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest 
 Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started

 No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss 
 And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit 
 Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun 
 They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come 
 I'm never scared, they never real, I never run 
 When all is said and done, more is always said than done 
 And I was told once, things will change 
 By a nigga named Tip when my deal came 
 Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange 
 Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names 
 Rochelle, Jordan 
 Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand 
 How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth? 
 How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth? 
 Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all 
 Remember how I used to feel at the start of it 
 And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale 
 And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it 
 Yeah, just lie to my ears 
 Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear 
 Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas 
 And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now 
 Uh, but believe I remember it all 
  
  
 My mother is back to who she was years ago 
 It's like a new page me and her are beginning on 
 I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand 
 'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on 
 She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth 
 But I'd never break the promises I made to myself 
 And I would never make up names for myself 
 Then change the names that I just gave to myself 
 Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?"" 
 I used to brag about it to my friends 
 And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat 
 And maybe that's all they do is just pretend 
 Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it 
 Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it 
 Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love 
 'Cause I thought it was all I needed 
 Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along 
 And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit 
 They trip off the amount of people that I brought along 
 But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit 
 Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids 
 I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live 
 I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did 
 Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home 
  
  
 Tell me, who did I leave behind? 
 You think it got to me, I can just read your mind 
 You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now 
 Uh, but believe I remember it all

 It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over 
 Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over 
 Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker 
 I'll slow roast ya, got no holster 
 Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster 
 Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster 
 G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker 
 They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker 
 I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier 
 My cup runneth over 
 The same niggas I ball with, I fall with 
 On some southern drawl shit 
 Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit 
 D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all 
 These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on 
 Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off 
 First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go 
  
  
 And I'd take probation 
 I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation 
 Private plane, pick location 
 I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation 
 Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard 
 And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it 
 But in the meantime you can call me young Roy 
 Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge 
 Shit, don't leave me unguarded 
 And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi 
 Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed 
 All that blood like the Red Sea parted 
 My gun go crazy like it's retarded 
 Red light on it like it's recording 
 I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in' 
 My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't 
 Better dig in your pocket and pay homage 
 Better cover your eyes, your face fallin' 
 Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin' 
 No, I didn't say that I'm flawless 
 But I damn sure don't tarnish 
 My pistol got comments for your garments 
 I'm so high I can vomit on a comet 
 K-Y, no homo, I'm on it 
 Weezy F Baby, new born bitch 
 You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch 
 I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get 
 Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit 
 And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit 
 That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit 
 That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit 
 And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit 
 I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!"" 
 Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me! 
 You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat 
 Fireman burn down your entire street 
 So fly I'ma take off when I leap 
 Bye! And you can suck my wings 
 Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming 
 Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things 
 I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens 
 But I ain't the dealer 
 House full of bitches like Tila Tequila 
 Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror 
 My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her? 
 Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read? 
 We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

 And basically, to see a change in me 
 I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah

 But it's you I wanna take apart 
 And I will never ever be the first, to say it 
 But still I, they know I 
 I would do it, push a button 
 Pull a trigger, climb a mountain 
 Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby

 What they already know, know, know 
 As soon as it's official 
 We'll have to let it go, go, go 
 So we don't confirm the fling 
 Keep avoiding all the questions 
 You could teach me many things 
 I'm just scared to learn a lesson 
 The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome 
 Both in sync like a Justin song 
 Feels so right but it's just, so wrong 
 I wonder where my world 'bout 
 When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out 
 And her friends say I ain't the one to go for 
 She just jealous cause you always get approached more 
 Oh well, tell her fall back 
 Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back 
 Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass

 Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny 
 Nah, I got a decent set of manners 
 And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner 
 And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour 
 Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana 
 So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it 
 But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it 
 You could show up at the party on dirty public transit 
 And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids 
 Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed 
 With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed

 So over-stand me 
 I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy 
 And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy 
 And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana 
 And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin' 
 And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick 
 Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop"" 
 She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop

 Uh-huh 
  
  
 Uh, hardly home but always reppin' 
 You hardly on and always second 
 When I'm awake, you always restin' 
 And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned 
 I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions 
 Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin' 
 That's why I never follow y'all suggestions 
 I just always did my own thing 
 Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas 
 I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes 
 Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better 
 'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

 Yeah, wrong way down a one-way 
 Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday 
 Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who 
 Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you"" 
 And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house 
 Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth 
 Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her 
 I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther 
 I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady 
 They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady 
 Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy 
 Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady 
 Damn, whose line is it anyways? 
 I'm in a daze, you been amazed 
 Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage 
 I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze 
 I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice 
 And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright 
 Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will 
 I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real

 Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest 
 Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused 
 The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's 
 Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust 
 Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on 
 I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb 
 I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight 
 From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike 
 Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night 
 Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white 
 Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right 
 Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night 
 This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long 
 The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song 
 UGK and Young Money, too strong 
 Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

 October's own 
 Please leave me alone 
 Drunk off champagne 
 Screamin' in the phone 
 See my house is not a home 
 Fuck is going on? 
 Where did we go wrong? 
 Where do we belong? 
 Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone 
 Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on 
 When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone 
 Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne 
 And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't 
 Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known 
 To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone 
 Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown 
 I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown 
 It's only been three years 
 Look at how I've grown 
 I'm just in my zone 
 I call this shit the calm 
 Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm 
 Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond 
 Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long 
 You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm 
 Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known 
 I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne 
 I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause 
  
  
 You know everything gon' be all right, I promise 
 I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but 
 40 Mama always say don’t ask permission 
 Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah 
 Say 
  
  
 Uh 
 And life is so insane 
 Look what I became trying to make a name 
 All my first dates are interrupted by my fame 
 Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain 
 They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain 
 It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain 
 Women need attention, therefore, women will complain 
 Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame 
 Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game 
 I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne 
 It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing 
 So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain 
 Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange 
 'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed 
 Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range 
 And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change 
 Damn, and I can only feel his pain 
 'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain 
 So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again 
 He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain 
 I'm why your girl heart is in a sling 
 Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame 
 As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king 
 With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain 
 Yeah, and see, this is the thang 
 What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain 
 The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane 
 Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

 Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'

 'Cause money always knows best

 You've got me fe– 
 You, ohhhh 
  
  
 Don't link me 
 Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song 
 Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along 
 I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone 
 And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on 
 I can't even capture the feeling I had at first 
 Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works 
 The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse 
 Their actions out of character even when they rehearse 
 Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave 
 I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place 
 Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved 
 And they don't like that, it's written all on they face 
 I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean 
 Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team 
 Iconic duos rip and split at the seams 
 Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes 
 Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe 
 Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace 
 Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet 
 Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me? 
  
  
 You've got me fe– 
 You, ohhhh 
 You've got me fe– 
 You, ohhhh, ayy 
  
  
 Missin' out on my years 
 There's times when I wish I was where I was 
 Back when I used to wish I was here 
 Missin' out on my days 
 Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise 
 Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways 
 I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade 
 Most times it's just somebody that's underaged 
 That's probably just alone and afraid 
 And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain 
 I always hear people complain about the place that they live 
 That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give 
 'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit 
 That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is 
 I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome 
 Then she finally got to Rome 
 And all she did was post pictures for people at home 
 'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known 
 I know another girl that's cryin' out for help 
 But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone"" 
 I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone 
 I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown 
 To post later and make it look like she still on the go 
 Look at the way we live 
 I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world 
 I was hidin' the world from my kid 
 From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate 
 Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate 
 Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs 
 The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call 
 They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?"" 
 You know a wise man once said nothin' at all 
 I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend 
 All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch 
 All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end? 
 I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

 And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside 
 It really boils down to how you plan to survive 
 Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em 
 Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em? 
 Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom 
 And they recognize the bathroom 
 All hell starts to break loose in my texts 
 I only tell lies to who I gotta protect 
 I would rather have you remember me how we met 
 I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect 
 But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step 
 That ain't what I'm 'bout 
 I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt 
 If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without 
 They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without 
 Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house 
 My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South 
 Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts? 
 Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out? 
 Is there more? Yeah 
  
  
 Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice 
 The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth 
 Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot 
 Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs 
 I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who? 
 I'll let you bring a thousand recruits 
 My peers are a talented group 
 But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two 
 Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops 
 There's still nothin' they could really do 
 It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due 
 Whenever it's time to recoup 
 Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal 
 In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?"" 
 I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die 
 What you got, time on your hands or time on your side? 
 Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? 
 Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? 
 Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies 
 Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties 
 And all of these fortunate times 
 And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? 
 Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? 
 Like healin' my soul, like family time 
 Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? 
 Is there more? 
  
  
 Passion, instant

 Yesterday morning was crazy 
 I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe 
 That shit is in stone, sealed and signed 
 She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine 
 Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time 
 And all it took was one time 
 Shit, we only met two times, two times 
 And both times were nothin' like the new times 
 Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines 
 Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes 
 It's breakin' my spirit 
 Single father, I hate when I hear it 
 I used to challenge my parents on every album 
 Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent 
 Always promised the family unit 
 I wanted it to be different because I've been through it 
 But this is the harsh truth now 
 And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now 
 I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at 
 Or who loves you more or who's not there 
 Who did what to who 'fore you got here 
 Nah, look, I'm too proud 
 To let that come between me and you now 
 Realize I gotta think for two now 
 I gotta make it, I better make it 
 I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated 
 This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated 
 I can't forget the looks on they faces 
 Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin' 
 Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out 
 For our cheers to the next generation 
 But this Champagne toast is short-lived 
 I got an empty crib in my empty crib 
 I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick 
 I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts 
 Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit 
 But man, you know 
 I still had to get it for my boy though, you know 
 You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip 
 He probably coulda did stand-up 
 Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up 
 And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up 
 October baby for irony's sake, of course 
 I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours 
 And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more 
 Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground 
 They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town 
 Hopefully by the time you hear this 
 Me and your mother will have come around 
 Instead of always cuttin' each other down 
 God willin', I got a good feelin' 
 You got a good spirit 
 We'll talk more when you hear this my G 
  
  
 I'm changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 No one to guide me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man 
 I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain 
 Of changing from boy to a man

 No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina 
 Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season 
 Queen Street visions that nobody believed in 
 If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin' 
 Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd 
 The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin' 
 Not when everybody out here beefin' 
 We got it, now we just gotta keep it 
 America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run 
 All these number ones and we still not the ones 
 No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun 
 Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb 
 Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin' 
 My competition, it's beyond offensive 
 I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention 
 Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance 
 Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission 
 This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches? 
 Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it 
 Too late for condolences when it's over with 
 I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it 
 Be open with people I need some closure with 
 Be honest with myself and take ownership 
 Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn 
 I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first 
 Excitin' times, revitalized 
 Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively 
 I'm just takin' what God will give me 
 Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey 
 Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me 
 I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky 
 I wrote the book on world-class finesses 
 And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts 
 And never placin' second 
 And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second 
 Inspirin' and never takin' credit 
 I know I deserve more, I just never said it

 Winnin' is problematic 
 People like you more when you workin' towards somethin' 
 Not when you have it 
 Way less support from my peers 
 In recent years as I get established 
 Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage 
 Why is my struggle different than others'? 
 Only child that’s takin' care of his mother 
 As health worsens and bills double 
 That’s not respectable all of a sudden? 
 I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up? 
 What do you see when you see me? 
 When did all the things I mean 
 From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning? 
 Maybe I share it with too many people 
 Back then it used to just feel like our secret 
 Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it 
 I be tryna manifest the things I needed 
 And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me 
 But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all 
 How they go from not wantin' me at all 
 To wantin' to see me lose it all? 
 Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin' 
 I'm overcome with emotions 
 Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober 
 Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra 
 I could only speak what I know of 
 Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin' 
 And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin' 
 And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin' 
 All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies 
 Ego strokin', picture postin' 
 Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only 
 But you just had to show me 
 See, I know, 'cause I study you closely 
 I know when someone lyin' 
 I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired 
 I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet 
 Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

 Hand on my heart 
 And I, I wish time never mattered 
  
  
 Yeah, stylin’ though 
 Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though 
 All the things you need, you still want problems though 
 All the things I know, I still been silent though 
 Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo 
 Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes 
 I don't want to have to go to funerals 
 I gotta start sleepin' at the studio 
 I don't have no time to be no Romeo 
 All the love I need is at the rodeo 
 All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah 
 All the girls I know are there with E and Tho 
 Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old? 
 Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes 
 Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone 
 I take a glass of Domina to go with me home 
 Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome 
 I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on 
 Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves 
 I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views 
 Saw a side of myself that I just never knew 
 I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do 
 Steady doin' double shifts 
 1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click 
 More blessings because I'm generous 
 Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us 
 Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet 
 She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it 
 Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it 
 Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it 
 Scary whenever I close my eyes at night 
 Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life 
 I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights 
 But you can rest assured that my mind is right 
 Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days 
 Never stick around to see shit change 
 Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' 
 Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin' 
 Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV 
 To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' 
 I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this 
 Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense 
 Especially people that want to lecture me 
 And frame it like they just want the best for me 
 Or they check for me, whatever splits it up 
 So there's more for them and there's less for me 
 They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me 
 No one's done it successfully 
 7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me 
 Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery 
 Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me 
 That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency 
 Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally 
 Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly 
 If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me 
 You overnight celebrity, you one day star 
 Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity 
 I am a reflection of all of your insecurities 
 Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping 
 Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me 
 There's real ones around me 
 I want to make sure they learn from me 
 I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety 
 He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency 
 My life is centered 'round competition and currency 
 Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery 
 Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me 
 I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

 Much closer 
 All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore 
 Guess that's what they say you need family for 
 Cause I can't depend on you anymore 
  
  
 Always saw you for what you could've been 
 Ever since you met me 
 Like when Chrysler made that one car 
 That looked just like the Bentley 
 I always saw you for what you could've been 
 And even when it's business with you it's personal again 
 I knew you before you made ends meet 
 And now we're meeting our end 
  
  
 And it's all because you chose a side 
 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You're so predictable I hate people like you 
 Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you 
 How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through 
 You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
 You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures

 Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on

 You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me 
 Guess it wasn't time (yeah) 
 And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine 
  
  
 You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align 
 My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right 
 When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice 
 But you always had something to say every other time 
 Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way 
 I'm fooding and serving them all 
 Like I'm working for minimum wage 
 Someone up there must just love testing my patience 
 Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment 
 Forgiveness for your ways 
 If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised 
 Same way I'm right here still feeling the way 
 Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

 I hate a goofy especially 
 They always dyin' to mention me 
 They gotta die out eventually 
 I cannot give you the recipe 
 You know the game is sold separately 
 Swear I just had an epiphany 
 It cost me 50 at Tiffany's

 Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny 
 Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies 
 Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries 
 Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it 
 He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement 
 He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment 
 Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission 
 We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him 
 Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know 
 Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show 
 I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?"" 
 I mean, you boys not even coming close 
 I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration 
 You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places 
 Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear 
 Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care 
 No tender love and care, no love and affection 
 I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting 
 I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson 
 Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together 
 Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester 
 40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure 
 A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin' 
 A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation 
 Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day 
 You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday 
 You don't be scorin' perfect 
 You don't be workin' like how we be workin' 
 You platinum like wrappers 
 On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless 
 You get the message over and over like it was urgent 
 And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person 
 The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in 
 And did it with a purpose 
 Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships 
 Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension 
 A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned 
 Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention 
 It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder 
 The most successful rapper 35 and under 
 I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under 
 That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded 
 Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin 
 She violated, I sent her back where it all started 
 How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment 
 Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness 
 Told my momma that I found a lady in the east 
 Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite 
 Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free 
 I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me 
 You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique 
 Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats 
 I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat 
 Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE 
 The best ever, don't ever question, you know better 
 But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together 
 Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it 
 Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled 
 Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal 
 Don't let your newfound fame fool you 
 Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this 
 Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter 
 Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit 
 Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it 
 Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it 
 Too busy face screwin' on waste movements 
 You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin' 
 First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it 
 And they still take to it 
 Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid 
 And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it 
 But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful 
 But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want 
 Get high when I want

 Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women 
 I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it

 Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment 
 Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me 
 That mean a lot to me 
 Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me 
 This year for Christmas I just want apologies 
 Sydney gave up on me when I went missin' 
 Syn had a baby and treated me different 
 Erika sued me and opened a business 
 Wonder if they wish it could've been different 
 Wonder what they'd do put in my position 
 I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen? 
 Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions 
 I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven 
 Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough 
 Until enough is enough, and then it's too much 
 You tip the scale when I weigh my options 
 West Palm girls are spoiled rotten 
 Tiffany on you, you know you poppin' 
 I'll kill somebody if they give you problems 
 Master bedroom's where we get it poppin' 
 Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet 
 I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit 
 Sell my secrets and get top dollar 
 Sell my secrets for a Range Rover 
 Opportunity and temptation 
 They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation 
 Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin' 
 Who's gonna save me when I need savin'? 
 Since Take Care, I've been caretakin' 
 But second chances, that ain't how you livin'

 Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure 
 And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham 
 A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section 
 OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up 
 And I know who gon' take the fall with me 
 They right here on call with me, they all with me 
 You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted 
 They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it? 
 Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me 
 I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me 
 Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday 
 Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray 
 I dropped out right before I graduate 
 Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day 
 “It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait” 
 And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say 
 Lately I just feel so out of character 
 The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance 
 Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist 
 I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison 
 I'm gettin' straight to the point with it 
 Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas 
 Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition 
 It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business 
 But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute 
  
  
 Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals 
 My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below 
 Who you think runnin' this show? 
 You saw it in me at 20 years old 
 The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code 
 I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate 
 You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made 
 Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change 
 Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game 
 Still drop 40 with liquor in my system 
 Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance 
 I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya 
 Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian 
 Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale 
 And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales 
 Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL 
 I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself 
 Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts 
 I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts 
 They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon 
 I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room 
 Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus 
 And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us 
 Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever 
 I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together 
 And my life is on display like Truman 
 They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner 
 My exes made some of my favorite music 
 I dated women from my favorite movies 
 Karma's such a thing of beauty 
 I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it 
 It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters 
 I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever 
 I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you 
 If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

 But, I'm not really sure what else you expected 
 When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective 
 With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message 
 40, did you get the message? 
 'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it 
 I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort 
 But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together 
 Yeah, not here to fight wars 
 But niggas wanna talk high scores 
 PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche 
 And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for 
 But, I got bigger fish to fry 
 I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I 
 Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine 
 And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified 
 Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night 
 Flyin' over Chattanooga 
 Out here tryna spread the movement 
 I just got me the Mercedes Pullman 
 You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google 
 Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal 
 These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies 
 They've been droppin' out on both sides 
 We ain't in it, we just ghost ride 
 The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines 
 I thought you wanted yours like I want mine 
 I guess you just makin' moves on your own time 
 But just know it'll be January in no time 
 And your absence is very concernin' 
 It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin' 
 Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30 
 Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey 
 I got a club in the Raptors arena 
 Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons 
 Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with 
 I'm legally obligated if they request it 
 So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson 
 Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction 
 Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting 
 Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum 
 I just listened to Closer to My Dreams 
 Wide eyed and uneducated at 19 
 I can't rap like that, all young and naive 
 Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe 
 Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience 
 I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it 
 4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious 
 You loved me back in the basement 
 Guess it is what we make it 
 I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways 
 Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away 
 Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother 
 The season start and I don't wanna 
 See you end up with nothin' 
 Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion 
 Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin' 
 They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden 
 Now you the one gettin' buckets 
 They put their arm around you 
 Now you becomin' the crutches 
 Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to 
 And women that you seen on TV look better in person 
 And either they wanna fuck you or convince you 
 That they care to see where it goes from there 
 But these ain't the girls from Brampton 
 This ain't that local action 
 The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually 
 What happened to the things 
 You niggas said was supposed to happen? 
 Are we just supposed to 
 Ignore the fact that it never happened? 
 We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two? 
 Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you? 
 My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf 
 And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves 
 Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios 
 6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit 
 When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I 
 And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""

 Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it 
 I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it 
 I told 1da send me something and I got it covered 
 Somehow I always rise above it 
 Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? 
 The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive 
 Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor 
 Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested 
 Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question 
 Last night I went to sleep wanting more 
 Tryna decide what direction I should go towards 
 Some nights I wish I could go back in life 
 Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice 
 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me 
 Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me 
 Prolly forever if I stay in my zone 
 I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone 
 I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe 
 That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside 
 Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage 
 You need to act your age and not your girl's age 
 It gets worse by the annual 
 My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man 
 Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah 
 I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em 
 To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention 
 I remember when it used to be music that did it 
 But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? 
 I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with 
 I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with 
 If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin' 
 We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on 
 But here we are, yeah 
 Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence 
 They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments 
 Bitches alter my messages like we had words 
 And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve 
 Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing 
 Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image 
 I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year 
 Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year 
 And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot 
 'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block 
 Nobody lookin' out for nobody 
 Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody 
 Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it 
 And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it 
 And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it 
 Damn, I just had to say my piece about it 
 Oh, you gotta love it— 
 But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject 
 I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget 
 I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins 
 Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca 
 Julia, Ericka, Southern America 
 Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance 
 Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow 
 Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent 
 I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' 
 But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement 
 Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? 
 Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too 
 I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas 
 Bein' number two is just being the first to lose 
 My city dictated music, nobody seein' us 
 Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up 
 Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough 
 Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup 
 Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all 
 You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all 
 ""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago 
 Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go 
 Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? 
 Why you rappin' like you come from the streets? 
 I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees 
 And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves 
 Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease 
 I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese 
 Special order for anybody that's comin' for me 
 Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze 
 You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me 
 Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free 
 I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat 
 Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats 
 Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah 
 And on top of that it's getting harder to eat 
 Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease 
 To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me 
 And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe 
 But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh) 
 Yeah 
 And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop) 
 I know your girl well, just not in public 
 Blame the city, I'm a product of it 
 Young nigga from the city 
 You gotta love it

 Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record 
 Just to off these records, nigga that's a record 
 I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure 
 Past the present when you have to mention 
 This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though 
 Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go 
 Heavy airplay all day with no chorus 
 We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas 
 I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga 
 I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga 
 Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga 
 I could go a hour on this beat, nigga 
 I'm just as famous as my mentor 
 But that's still the boss, don't get sent for 
 Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for 
 Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more 
 Hot temper, scary outcome 
 Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one 
 That always let they mouth run 
 Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it 
 Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it 
 Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick 
 Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit 
 Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich 
 Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup 
  
  
 Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV 
 Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me 
 Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me 
 I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family 
 Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' 
 I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it 
 I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it 
 Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin' 
 On a mission tryna shift the culture 
 Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit 
 Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin' 
 All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments 
 Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message 
 Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive 
 That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure 
 Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort 
 I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless 
 Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace 
 My life's a completed checklist 
 I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now 
 Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now 
 That's real 
  
  
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento 
 I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo 
 The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk 
 Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow 
 This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo 
 I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em) 
 The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie 
 All these 90's fantasies on my mind 
 The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time 
 I might come through without security to check if you're fine 
 That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO 
 Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself"" 
 You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself 
 And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help 
 You know, back on your feet and shit 
 Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? 
 How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? 
 Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese 
 And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup 
 How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

 Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive 
 Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance 
 I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping 
 I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different 
 Started realizing a couple places I could take it 
 I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement 
 I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation 
 And influence a generation that's lacking in patience 
 I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience 
 Just me and my old man getting back to basics 
 We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted 
 When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing 
 Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas 
 We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us 
 We even talked about you and our couple of moments 
 He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups 
 You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone 
 Looking like you came from the 70's on your own 
 My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is 
 Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? 
 You don't even know what you want from love anymore 
 I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? 
 Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? 
  
  
 I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

 Darling you, you give but you cannot take love 
  
  
 Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures 
 Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage 
 When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit 
 A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 
 'Cause that night I played her three songs 
 Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on 
 Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz 
 Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off 
 Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria 
 Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria 
 Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music 
 When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it 
 The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree 
 I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me 
 Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? 
 Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't 
 Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz 
 Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision 
 Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions 
 When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven 
 It seem like you don't want this love anymore 
 I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore 
 But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?

 That she can barely remember 
 And I'd allow her 
 Talk about pussy power 
 She just wanna run over my feelings 
 Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler 
 And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power 
 She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself"" 
 Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was 
 And never leave as myself 
 But when it falls apart, I'm always still down 
 To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground 
 Wish you would learn to love people and use things 
 And not the other way around

 She call and tell me be here before the sun up 
 I be dressed before we hung up

 And exit at Markham road in the east end 
 Where all the pretty girls are sleeping 
 My license been expired I renew it after the weekend 
 Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends

 I hate stoppin' for gas this late 
 Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin' 
 Summer is comin' know you could feel it

 Won't knock on your door

 Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there

 Done sayin' I'm done playin' 
 Last time was on the outro 
 Stuck in the house, need to get out more 
 I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising 
 Most people in my position get complacent 
 Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages 
 I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it 
 Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it 
 I'm the only one that's putting shots up 
 And like a potluck, you need to come with it 
 Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100 
 Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted 
 I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it 
 Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming? 
 Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"" 
 These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there 
 Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out 
 Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now 
 Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out 
 She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

 No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'

 My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list 
 And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit 
 Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit 
 Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear 
 Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here 
 Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself 
 That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit 
 And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now 
 Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now

 Money on my mind, you should think the same 
 J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine 
 In the same league, but we don't ball the same 
 (Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time 
 She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line"" 
 Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up 
 Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"" 
 You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo 
 Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note 
 From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off 
 And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off 
 This that sauce, this that dressing 
 Givenchy, nigga, God bless you 
 If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

 I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6 
 I even fucked the girl that used to babysit 
 But that was years later on some crazy shit 
 I heard your new shit, nigga hated it 
 Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit 
 I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit 
 And my latest shit is like a greatest hits 
 God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side 
 Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all 
 It's no different over on this side 
 God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself? 
 'Cause myself just told myself: 
 ""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"" 
 Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest 
 Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets 
 I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath 
 I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever 
 It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet 
 Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle 
 I was made for all of this shit 
 And I’m on the road box office sales 
 I’m getting paid for all of this shit 
 Ask you to please excuse my table manners 
 I was making room for the table dancers 
 'Cause if we judging off your advances 
 Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

 Ho, shut the fuck up! 
 I got way too much on my mental 
 I learn from what I've been through 
 I'm finna do what I didn't do 
 And still waking up like the rent's due 
 Not complicated, it's simple 
 I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full 
 And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle 
 But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned 
 Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion 
 Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption 
 I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit 
 Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets 
 I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine 
 Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip 
 My new girl is on Glee and shit 
 Probably making more money than me and shit 
 I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
 I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one 
 Like I got trust issues 
 I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out 
 I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom 
 And still gotta pull out 
 But that's just me and I ain't perfect 
 I ain't a saint but I am worth it 
 If it's one thing, I am worth it 
 Niggas still hating but it ain't working 
 Lil' bitch... 
  
  
 Oh me, oh me, oh my 
 I think I done fucked too many women from the 305 
 'Fore the end of this year 
 I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times 
 Smoking on that kush all in our section 
 Like it's legalized 
 Girl, you can't always have your way 
 Sometimes it be like that 
 They don't really fuck with you like that 
 They ain't never did me like that 
 I just took my time, you got the shine 
 I let you eat like that 
 I been taught to never loan somebody 
 What you need right back 
 And I need that shit right back 
 (No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka 
 Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka 
 Niggas getting nervous 
 Clutching they chests like a muhfucka 
 Damn that’s a motherfucker 
 Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you 
 'Cause I don’t like being lied to 
 And that ship won’t sail 
 And that wind won’t guide you 
 Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window 
 Like a motherfucking drive-thru

 No, there's nothing wrong with me 
 There's just something wrong with you 
 So I've been making changes 
 Been workin' on my health 
 No more competition 
 Can't compete against myself, no, no, no 
 I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no 
 I've been doin' this to be remembered 
 Let the people hear it if they want to 
 Help the one's around me get it on, too 
 If I die tomorrow and I'm gone 
 Let the blood run high 
 Let the carpets drown 
 I'll be forever now

 Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

 In my living room 
 That have walked the sun 
 And have slept on the moon 
 Covered in the fragrance 
 Of their own perfume 
 Telling me the stories 
 Stories coming true 
 Well you see these angels 
 These angels see the light 
 Yeah I had my troubles 
 Troubles, all right 
 I've been seeing angels 
 Oh no 
  
  
 They'll hold onto their secrets 
 And torn up memories 
 We float above horizons 
 And sail across the seas 
 I hope for better days 
 And lightly times are tough 
 The angels give me strength 
 And I'm not giving up 
 So I wipe away my tears 
 I unveil my pain 
 They're brushing off my shoulders 
 And I hold on to their stain 
 I've been seeing angels 
  
  
 Angels

 Angels, ayy
