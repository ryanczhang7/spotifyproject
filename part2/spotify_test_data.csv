 to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain 
 we got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks 
 and stray shots all on the block that stays hot 
 leave it up to me while i be living proof

 i was taken by a photograph of you 
 there were one or two i know that you would have liked a little more 
 but they didnt show your spirit quite as true 
 you were turning round to see who was behind you 
 and i took your childish laughter by surprise 
 and at the moment that my camera happened to find you 
 there was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes now the things that i remember seem so distant and so small 
 though it hasnt really been that long a time 
 what i was seeing wasnt what was happening at all 
 although for a while our path did seem to climb 
 when you see through loves illusions there lies the danger 
 and your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool 
 so you go running off in search of a perfect stranger 
 while the loneliness seems to spring from your life 
 like a fountain from a pool fountain of sorrow fountain of light 
 youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight 
 youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right 
 and its good to see your smiling face tonight now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams 
 but that magic feeling never seems to last 
 and all the futures there for anyone to change still you know it seems 
 it would be easier sometimes to change the past 
 im just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you 
 in my lessons at loves pain and heartache school 
 where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you 
 theres this loneliness springing up from your life 
 like a fountain from a pool fountain of sorrow fountain of light 
 youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight 
 youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right 
 and its good to see your smiling face tonight fountain of sorrow fountain of light

 if im not feeling any less sour 
 i promise myself to treat myself 
 and visit a nearby tower 
 and climbing to the top 
 will throw myself off 
 in an effort to 
 make it clear to whoever 
 what its like 
 when youre shattered 
 left standing in the lurch at a church 
 were people are saying my god thats tough 
 she stood him up 
 no point in us remaining we may as well go home 
 as i did on my own 
 alone again naturally to think that only yesterday 
 i was cheerful bright and gay 
 looking forward to who wouldnt do 
 the role i was about to play 
 but as if to knock me down 
 reality came around 
 and without so much as a mere touch 
 cut me into little pieces 
 leaving me to doubt 
 talk about god in his mercy oh if he really does exist why did he desert me 
 in my hour of need i truly am indeed alone again naturally it seems to me that 
 there are more hearts 
 broken in the world 
 that cant be mended 
 left unattended 
 what do we do 
 what do we do 
 alone again naturally looking back over the years 
 and whatever else that appears 
 i remember i cried when my father died 
 never wishing to hide the tears 
 and at sixtyfive years old 
 my mother god rest her soul 
 couldnt understand why the only man 
 she had ever loved had been taken 
 leaving her to start 
 with a heart so badly broken 
 despite encouragement from me 
 no words were ever spoken 
 and when she passed away

 no entre tanta gente yo te vi llegar 
 algo en el destino me hizo saludar 
 te dije mi nombre y no sé dónde 
 como con un beso me respondes 
 sólo te importó que te tratara bien 
 tú de 19 y yo de 23 
 y empecé mis planes para vernos otra vez y si pudiera mostrarte 
 que estando juntos ya no hay nada que falte 
 y que a pesar de la distancia te voy a querer 
 sólo tienes que saber 
 que yo quisiera quedarme 
 y aunque no debo sólo quiero llamarte 
 que repitamos las historias una y otra vez no sé ¿cómo te pido que te enamores 
 cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tú llores 
 ¿cómo te pido que te ilusiones 
 y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones 
 ¿cómo te pido si al final no voy a estar 
 cuando de ti me enamore 
 cuando de ti me enamore recuerdo todo lo que te gustaba 
 y tu camisa que llega a los pies 
 esa carita cuando te cantaba por primera vez 
 me llevo todo y no me llevo nada 
 sin ti no hay nada todo te dejé 
 sé que es muy pronto para estas palabras pero las dire como tu mano y mi mano en la noche no sienten frío 
 sin ti las horas se pasan pero con días vacíos 
 como en marbella las olas tú estabas bella y a solas 
 y yo te extraño y te extraño pero te llamo y lo olvido como te quiero y te quiero pero este amor ya no es mío 
 sé que tu boca y mi boca cuando se juntan hay lío 
 cómo quisiera quedarme pero ahora no estás conmigo 
 siempre la vida se pasa pero no pasa contigo ¿cómo te pido que te enamores 
 cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tú llores 
 ¿cómo te pido que te ilusiones 
 y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones 
 ¿cómo te pido si al final no voy a estar 
 cuando de ti me enamore tú de 19 y yo de 23 
 cuando de ti me enamore tú de 19 y yo de 23 ¿cómo te pido que te enamores

 ¿cómo te pido si al final no voy a estar 
 cuando de ti me enamore tú de 19 y yo de 23 
 cuando de ti me enamore tú de 19 y yo de 23 y aunque yo esté en otra parte 
 soy más feliz porque yo pude encontrarte 
 y aunque no tenga la certeza de volverte a ver 
 es tuya esta canción

 tu olor en la cama aun sigue intacto 
 te he buscando en mis sueños deseando tenerte 
 y no encuentro tu rostro por más que trato aun quedan tus retratos por cada rincón de la casa 
 y el silecnio me habla de ti es que sobra tanto espacio 
 desde que no estás daría todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte 
 por que vuelvas es que me niego a perderte 
 jamás nunca verte 
 me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó y es que me niego a perderte 
 jamás nunca verte 
 me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó no puedo asimilar 
 que ya tú no estás sin ti nada es igual 
 sé que por el mundo no hay otra similar 
 ¿qué tú me hiciste que no te puedo olvidar ay hombre tú me quiere a tu manera 
 mi mente quisiera que otra me quisiera 
 mi corazón dice que por ti espera 
 que porque volvieras daría lo que fuera pero es que tú chica con ese pikete 
 dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes 
 ahora puedo decir sufrir amor lo que se siente 
 te sacaré e mi mente y eso será de repente pero es que tú chica con ese pikete 
 dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes 
 ahora puedo decir sufrir amor lo que se siente 
 te sacaré e mi mente y eso será de repente ay hombre es que me niego a perderte 
 jamás nunca verte 
 me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó es que me niego a perderte 
 jamás nunca verte 
 me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabó me está matando la soledad 
 duele saber que ya no estás 
 quiero pensar que todo esto es mentira 
 y que a alguien más le contestarás 
 al llegar la noche regresarás aun podemos intentar no te alejes de mi vida llorando de noche muriendo de día viviendo esta agonía 
 no puedo entender que ya no seas mía 
 el círculo se cierra y el dolor me entierra 
 que difícil es vivir en esta guerra me niego aunque digas que estoy ciego 
 desde que te fuiste soy un andariego 
 a todos compromisos tarde le llego 
 distraído de tu foto no me despego si tú eres mi vida ¿por qué me liquidas 
 yo no provoqué tu partida 
 necesito tu olor necesito tu calor 
 necesito verte encima de mi en ropa interior aun quedan tus retratos por cada rincón de la casa 
 y el silecnio me habla de ti es que sobra tanto espacio

 i was thinkin bout the band 
 i was thinkin bout the fans 
 we were underground 
 loadin merch in that 12passenger van 
 in a small club in minnesota 
 and the snow outside of 1st ave 
 i just wanted my name in a star 
 now look at where we at 
 still growin up still growin up 
 i would lay in my bed and dream about what id become 
 couldnt wait to get older couldnt wait to be some 
 now that im here wishing i was still young 
 those good old days

 that someday these will be the good old days

 wish i didnt think i had the answers 
 wish i didnt drink all of that flask first 
 wish i made it to homecoming 
 got up the courage to ask her 
 wish i wouldve gotten out of my shell 
 wish i put the bottle back on that shelf 
 wish i wouldnt have worry about what other people thought 
 and felt comfortable in myself 
 rooftop open and the stars above 
 moment frozen sneakin out and fallin in love 
 me you and that futon wed just begun 
 on the grass dreamin figuring out who i was

 maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was 
 maybe these are the moments 
 maybe ive been missin what its about 
 been scared of the future thinkin about the past 
 while missin out on now 
 weve come so far i guess im proud 
 and i aint worried bout the wrinkles round my smile 
 ive got some scars ive been around 
 ive felt some pain ive seen some things but im here now
